Actor Wendell Pierce told theatregoers he was “so sorry” after part of a ceiling collapsed during a West End performance.
The Piccadilly Theatre in Denman Street in central London was evacuated and emergency services called shortly before 8pm on Wednesday after part of the ceiling crashed down into the auditorium during a performance of Death Of A Salesman.
