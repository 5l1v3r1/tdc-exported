Fortnite YouTuber Faze Jarvis has been making Fortnite videos for over a year, accruing nearly two million subscribers in that time. But as of 3 November, Jarvis has been permanently banned from playing Fortnite for flagrant use of an aimbot in the Solos battle royale mode.Â 
Jarvis did nothing to hide the use of cheat software, treating it as the subject of a video in which he openly states his intent to use an aimbot on an alternate account, and proceeds to cheat in a public game, eliminating players with perfect accuracy in a long montage.
The video has since been deleted on Jarvis's channel, but has been captured and preserved by Fortnite Area.
