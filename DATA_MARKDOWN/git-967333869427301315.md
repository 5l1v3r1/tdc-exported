        Commenting on Trump’s stance on UK domestic politics, Corbyn also noted that he is concerned about the relationship between the US government and the Tory party and its potential impact on British public services.
      
UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivered a fresh verbal jab against US President Donald Trump after the latter claimed that Corbyn’s victory at the upcoming general election would be bad for the country.
Having previously claimed that Trump is attempting to interfere in the British electoral process and trying to get "his friend Boris Johnson" elected, Corbyn revealed how the so called "no-deal" Brexit scenario might also help Trump’s agenda, according to the Daily Mail.
Speaking during a campaign rally in Swindon, Corbyn noted that if Trump "isn't pleased at the prospect of a Labour government being elected in Britain", then he’s "entitled to his choice," adding that he’s willing to speak with Trump in order to discuss his stance on climate change policies.
Corbyn’s remarks come following Trump’s interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage on Britain’s LBC radio earlier this week, when the US president claimed that the Labour leader would be “bad” for the UK, while calling Prime Minister Boris Johnson a "fantastic man who was right for the times."
