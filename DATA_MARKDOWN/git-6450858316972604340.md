Microsoft has announced a new smartphone and tablet Office app for iOS and Android that combines Word, Excel and PowerPoint. You can still download and run the existing three apps individually, but this new Office app has some exclusive mobile-only features and is designed as a convenient hub for people who live in the Office 365 world.
“The new Office mobile app represents our vision for what a productivity solution would look like if first built for mobile devices. In designing this new experience, we first considered how people’s expectations differ when using a phone versus a computer, so we set out to optimize for simplicity, efficiency, and common mobile need,” said Bill Doll, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Office Apps Strategy at Microsoft in a blog post. 
It means that Microsoft is acknowledging that its individual mobile apps of Word, Excel and PowerPoint may be too tricky to use on phones and tablets given they are essentially ported versions of desktop programs. The new interface claims to easily surface documents from all three and connects to cloud storage for syncing across all devices, as you’d expect.
