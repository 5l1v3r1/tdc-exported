Chris Clark, the UK electronic producer who usually records under his last name, has been putting out records for more than a decade. Most of his records — including E.C.S.T. T.R.A.X., the 12″ EP he released last year — have been relatively cerebral experimental works, even when they’re at their most visceral. But on a new double-A-side single, Clark is going a different direction.
In a few weeks, Clark will release a new two-song single that features two tracks, “Branding Problem” and “Legacy Pet.” He’s just shared the six-minute “Legacy Pet,” a hard club track built from the same breakbeat that animated years of UK jungle music. The track has a few weird sounds and a lot of jittery keyboard melodies, and it hits more like a straight-up rave banger than like a deconstruction of a rave banger. Below, listen to the track and read what Clark has to say about the new single.
