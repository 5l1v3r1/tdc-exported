URBANDALE, Iowa - An Iowa woman is accused of leaving her 6-year-old grandchild home alone so she could attend church, authorities said.
Beatrice Brewer, 69, of Urbandale, was arrested Friday and charged with one count of child endangerment, KCCI reported.
A citizen saw the child walking alone on an UrbandaleÂ street Sept. 26 and called 911, the television station reported.
According to police, Brewer was caring for her grandchild when she left her apartment to attend church without verifying the safety of the child, WHO-TV reported. According to court documents, Brewer told police she was unable to find the child when she left for church, believing her grandchild was hiding or locked out of her apartment, the television station reported.
Brewer bonded out of Polk County Jail on Saturday, KCCI reported.
