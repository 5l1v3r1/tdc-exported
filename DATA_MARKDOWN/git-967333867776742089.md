        White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on Tuesday took aim at former Vice President Joe Biden, saying much of what he has been doing under the Trump administration has been aimed at “cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.”
      
The reply comes days after Biden said in a “60 Minutes” interview that Kushner and his wife, President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, should not have been appointed to serve in Trump’s administration.
