The Conservative Party has suspended election candidate Ross England after a judge accused him of “deliberately sabotaging” a rape trial.
England - a former aide to Cabinet Minister Alun Cairns - was giving evidence in the trial of his friend James Hackett, who’d been accused of rape when he claimed the victim had taken part in group sex – expressly contrary to the Judge’s ruling any information about the victim’s alleged sexual past inadmissible, as it wasn’t relevant to the case.
