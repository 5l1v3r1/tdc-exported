Microsoft today announced a new easy way to create scripts for Excel. The new Office Scripts feature will allow you to automate repetitive tasks. You no longer need to learn VB Script to write simple scripts for Excel.
Through this feature, you can record your actions inside an Excel workbook and save it to a script. Later you can use the script with Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) or integrate with your workflow. Once the script is created, users can share it with others. IT Admins can also centrally manage and facilitate the sharing of created scripts.
Microsoft announced that this new Office Scripts feature will be available as a public preview by the end of the year.
