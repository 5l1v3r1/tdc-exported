In case you forgot, Nvidia isn't the only game in town when it comes to Android TV. Xiaomi offers a much more affordable option in its Mi Box S — and that device just became a more appealing alternative thanks to an official Android 9 Pie beta program.
Android 9 Pie doesn't bring much in the way of cosmetic changes — the UI is more or less the same as it was on Oreo — but it does include some key upgrades like official Prime Video support.
