LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- More than $6 million has been approved to start work on two new schools in Estero.
The first school was allotted nearly $4 million. It'll be a middle school in the south zone. They're calling it "NN Middle School."
The second was a little more than $2 million for the South Zone Elementary School, which they're calling "K School."
The funds will cover costs related to permitting, architects, and more.
