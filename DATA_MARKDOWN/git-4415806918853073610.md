US President Donald Trump has said he will make Palm Beach in Florida his permanent residence after he leaves the White House, rather than returning to Trump Tower in New York.
Mr Trump said he cherished New York. But he added that “despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state”.
