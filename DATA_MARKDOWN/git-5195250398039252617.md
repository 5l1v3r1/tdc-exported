MG Motor India Limited has inaugurated a new campaign featuring the popular Hollywood star Benedict Cumberbatch. Going by the tagline #ChangeWhatYouCan, MG says it focusses on igniting an electric vehicle revolution. The campaign aims at calling upon Indians to lead the environmental protection through the adoption of zero-emission vehicles and set the path for a “positive societal change”.
The British manufacturer believes that India is at the cusp of a revolution and that the Indian people should champion environmental conservation through EV adoption. The core proposition of the campaign deals with making personal changes contributing to a large scale transformation and Benedict’s narration stresses the need for a change in the mindset beforehand.
The SAIC-owned company has already introduced several initiatives to raise electric vehicle awareness amongst domestic customers noticeably alongside joining hands with global key players to consolidate the country’s EV charging ecosystem ahead of its first EV launch in the country.
