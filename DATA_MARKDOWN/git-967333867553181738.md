        New Delhi (Sputnik): With the deadline of 120 days after publication of the final National Register for Citizens (NRC) in the northeastern Indian state of Assam fast approaching, the state government is allegedly setting up several detention centres for “illegal immigrants”.
      
The final list of the apex court monitored NRC was published on 31 August and almost 1.9 million people were found to be without valid citizenship documents. They were given 120 days time to appeal before almost a 100 Foreigners Tribunals set up across Assam.
A team of leaders of India’s main opposition Congress Party visited some of these centres in the Silchar district of the state to take stock of the situation. Senior Congress leader and former federal minister Dr Jairam Ramesh said he found 48 detainees in camps, who are Indian citizens without "proper" citizenship documents.
