LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- A traffic stop led deputies to drugs hidden in an unlikely fashion in Lee County.
A Lee County Sheriff’s Office Community Response Unit says they saw a driver speeding and recklessly changing lanes and pulled the driver over.
That driver, 35-year-old Mario Bates, was found to have a cancelled driver’s license.
During a check of the car, the deputy found five socks containing bottles of codeine syrup.
Bates was charged with reckless driving, knowingly driving without a license, and drug trafficking.
