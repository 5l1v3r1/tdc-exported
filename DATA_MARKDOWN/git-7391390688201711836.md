Based on the real-life scams of alleged con artist Anna Delvey, Shonda Rhimes' Netflix series, Inventing Anna, will star Julia Garner as the title character, the streaming service announced via Twitter on Thursday, Oct. 31. Joining the Emmy-winning Ozark actor in the Inventing Anna cast, per Netflix, is: Anna Chlumsky as Vivian, a reporter "determined to get [Delvey's] story", Laverne Cox as life coach Kacy Duke, Katie Lowes as Delvey worshiper Rachel, and Alexis Floyd as aspiring filmmaker Neff.
An Oct. 31 tweet from the official Shondaland Twitter account described Garner's Delvey character as "a young woman in her mid-20s with a hard to place European accent who takes New York by storm." The post goes on to summarize Delvey as "either a brilliant business woman or a scammer extraordinaire" who leaves behind "an emotional body count." (Collider previously reported on Oct. 21 that Garner was in talks to play Delvey in what will be just one of several upcoming Shondaland Netflix series.)
The Inventing Anna logline published by TV Line further describes "the Instagram-infamous German heiress who stole the hearts of New York’s social scene — and stole their money as well" as awaiting trial in the Netflix limited series. Delvey and Chlumsky's journalist character "form a dark funny love-hate bond" as the latter "fights the clock to answer the biggest question in NYC: who is Anna Delvey?"
