        Britain faces a General Election on 12 December and around the country there will be fierce battles in all 650 constituencies. But the contest may be a little less heated in some places after several pro-EU parties signed an unofficial electoral pact.
      
The Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed up to an electoral pact which could make life harder for the Conservatives in several constituencies on election day.
All three parties share pro-European platforms and have agreed a deal not to field candidates in 60 constituencies where they are up against Conservative MPs or challengers.
