Krystal has returned to Instagram for the first time in a month.
She has been inactive to mourn the passing of her good friend Sulli. She uploaded a series of three photos, two in a casual plaid shirt and one in a beautiful dress.
Fans are voicing their concern for her well being after this recent update, stating: 

        "Stay strong."
      

        "Soojung... you should take legal action against malicious commenters as well."
      

        "I support you!"
      
We hope Krystal stays healthy and is doing well.
