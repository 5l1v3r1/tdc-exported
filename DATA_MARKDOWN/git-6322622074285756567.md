KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): RHB Retail Research said Gadang Holdings Bhd may rise higher after it recently breached above the downtrend line drawn in the chart.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said in view that the 21-day SMA line is likely to begin turning upwards, this implies a positive outlook sentiment.
“A positive bias may emerge above the 70 sen level, with an exit set below the 65.5 sen threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the 78 sen mark. This is followed by the 82.5 sen level,” it said.
