Earlier this year, reports arose that China — once one of the cryptocurrency capitals of the world — was looking to ban Bitcoin mining.
As reported by NewsBTC at the time, the SCMP reported that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has revealed a draft list of industrial activities the government is interested in restricting or outright banning, which include cryptocurrency mining. With China’s Sichuan region, full of rivers, purportedly housing a large portion of the hash power backing the Bitcoin network, many were quick to take issue with this move.
According to a new document, however, this isn’t China’s plan.
On Tuesday evening, Chinese cryptocurrency insider Dovey Wan found that the NDRC has eliminated Bitcoin mining from its list of industries to phase out over time. According to a roughly translated version of the article in question, the “consultation paper” that indicated that the NDRC cryptocurrency mining operations due to environmental damage has been “deleted,” implying that there will no longer be a concerted effort to stem the flow of resources to China’s Bitcoin miners over time.
