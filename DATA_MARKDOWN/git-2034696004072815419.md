It looks like a new collaboration between Frank Ocean and Justice is on the way next year.
Speaking on Beats 1, Mike D of the Beastie Boys seemingly confirmed the news after he revealed that he’d heard a couple of “sneak previews” of music the French electronic duo were working on for 2020 whilst he was in Paris with the other members of the group. “They were really, really good,” Mike D added.
He then added: “There’s a track that’s coming down next year, Frank Ocean and Justice,” Mike D revealed. “It’s wicked,” he joked, in a mock English accent.
