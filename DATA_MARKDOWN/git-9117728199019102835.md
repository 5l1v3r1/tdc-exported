        After leading the midfield in qualifying once again, McLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr. was eager to point out the progress his team has made compared to last season, with the Spaniard almost equalling last season's pole-setting time.
      
Sainz's 1:32.8 is almost two and a half seconds quicker than Fernando Alonso's time for McLaren in 2018, underlining just how far the Woking-based team have come compared to last campaign, when they finished the year in sixth place.
Now, the side sit in fourth place and comfortably so, with Sainz leading the charge as he's wrapped up in a battle for sixth place in the championship with Alexander Albon and Pierre Gasly.
“It’s crazy,” the 25-year-old told RaceFans.net on his team's progress in 12 months.
“A [1:]32.8 around here, we got really close to the pole lap of last year I think so McLaren has made huge a step forwards.”
