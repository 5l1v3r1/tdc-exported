        Jarvis Kaye, the professional Fortnite player and YouTuber who received a lifetime ban from the game for cheating, likely earned around £20,000 for his apology video.
      
Kaye, also known as FaZe Jarvis, was caught cheating after he uploaded videos that showed him using aimbots – a cheat that vastly improves the accuracy of a person’s shot.
The 17-year-old, who has more than 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel and more than 200,000 followers on Twitch, admitted his actions in an emotional apology video but said he never considered that his actions would lead to a ban.
