        Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening near the Israeli city of Sderot, which sits a short distance from the border with Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Force. Several hours later, the IDF responded with retaliatory strikes in Gaza.
      
Following two sets of rocket attacks near Sderot that originated in the Gaza Strip, Haaretz has reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in contact with the IDF chief of staff and is "instructing the army to respond to the rocket fire with the necessary measures."
