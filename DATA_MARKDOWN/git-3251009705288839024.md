The Island Express is an Indian Railways train running between Bangalore and Kanyakumari. Train No. 16526 runs from Bangalore to Kanyakumari, and Train No. 16525 runs in the reverse direction.
The train runs daily through the state of Kerala (via Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Palakkad) and covers the 944 km journey in about 19 hours 15 minutes.
No part of the train’s route is on an island; the name was given because the predecessor of this train used to end its journey at the Cochin Harbour Terminus station in Willingdon Island, Cochin, until the mid-1970s.
At that time, it was the only train that connected Bangalore (Karnataka state) to Kerala. This train is hauled by the WAP7 6,350 hp AC locomotive.
