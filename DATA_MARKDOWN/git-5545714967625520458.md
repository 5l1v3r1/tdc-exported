After the kerfuffle it caused last year, most fans were pretty sure Blizzard wouldn't utter a peep about Diablo ImmortalÂ during the opening ceremonies of this year's BlizzCon. They were right. Rather than relive the drama it caused in 2018, the publisher let it fly under the radar with some new developments announced for it later in the day. While we still don't have a release date for it -- Blizzard is aiming for that "Blizzard quality" it applies to all its games -- we did get our first look at the Demon Hunter class, one of six confirmed for the title.
