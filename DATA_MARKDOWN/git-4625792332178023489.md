Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe refused to say which allegations, if any, the FBI verified in British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier before the bureau used it extensively in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to surveil former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.
McCabe, who appeared on a panel at a George Mason University event Wednesday at the National Press Club, largely ducked two questions from the Washington Examiner about what specifically the FBI confirmed in Steele’s dossier and why the FBI didn't tell the court that Steele, whose dossier made a series of salacious and unverified claims about Trump and his connections to Russia, was ultimately being paid by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
McCabe said he would see what Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s highly anticipated report on possible FISA abuse had to say instead.
“So, the answer to your first question is no, I will not go into specificity about what the FBI verified prior to the FISA or after,” McCabe said. “And the answer to your second question is I will wait, as I’m sure you will, eagerly, to see what Mr. Horowitz’s conclusions are in that report. That’s a matter that is, I assume, at the center of his investigation, and I am anxious to see what his thoughts on it are.”
