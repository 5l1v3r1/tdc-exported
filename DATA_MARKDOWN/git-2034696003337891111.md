        It won't be happening anytime soon.
      
Johnny Marr has responded to fresh rumours of a potential reunion of The Smiths via a tweet from his official account which read: “Nigel Farage on guitar.”
The guitarist and solo star was replying to rumours that the indie veterans would reform with Morrissey at the helm and that a reunion was “closer than ever” on a fan forum earlier this week. In response to a fan on Twitter who asked Marr directly if the rumours were true after sharing a screen shot from the forum, Marr responded with the four word tweet, “Nigel Farage on guitar”.
Fans are now speculating as to whether this was barbed dig at Morrissey given his recent political statements.
You can see the tweet below.
