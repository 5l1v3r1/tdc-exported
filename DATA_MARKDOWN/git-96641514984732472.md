Netflix is working with Sandra Bullock on another feature film -- and likely hoping that the team-up can replicate the massive success of Bird Box. The actress will star in and produce a movie adaptation of British mini-series Unforgiven, which aired in 2009. It's about a woman trying to rebuild her life and reconnect with the younger sister she was forced to abandon after serving 15 years in prison for the murder of two police officers.
