FRANKFURT: The European Central Bank denied on Monday a report in the Financial Times that it is putting pressure on Deutsche Bank's Christian Sewing to give up his dual role as chief executive and investment bank head.
"The story is incorrect," an ECB spokeswoman said.
The FT had written that the ECB was concerned that Sewing's twin responsibilities could undermine the groupâ€™s radical restructuring and posed a potential conflict of interest.
