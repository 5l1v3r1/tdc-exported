Melbourne punk duo Cry Club wish the Melbourne Cup didn’t exist. And while many of us might labour over convincing our colleagues or family why we don’t support an event that sees animals slaughtered for sport, they’ve decided to protest the event by encouraging people to post pictures of their favourite cups and mugs instead.
On Twitter, Cry Club began by posting a keep cup they were given by their girlfriend’s mum. While not the cutest cup, it seemingly has sentimental value, and definitely hasn’t launched anyone into crippling debt: we approve.
