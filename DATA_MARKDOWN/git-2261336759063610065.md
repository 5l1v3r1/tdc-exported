Former title challenger and UFC heavyweight contender Derrick Lewis was candid about his dislike towards Greg Hardy. “The Black Beast” expressed his sentiments about the controversial heavyweight during a post-fight scrum after his decision win over Blagoy Ivanov at UFC 244.
“I want Greg Hardy to get his ass out of the UFC,” Lewis told reporters. “He’s making everyone else look bad. So, we don’t need him to win no more fights.”
Hardy hopped right back into action after UFC Boston in mid-October, as he takes on number-seven ranked contender Alexander Volkov in Moscow next weekend. Having locked horns with Volkov in the Octagon and winning via a come-from-behind knockout, Lewis isn’t counting on “The Prince of War” to win.
“They got on to him now, so I don’t think his ass can bring an inhaler to the cage to help him this time,” Lewis said of Hardy. “So I don’t think he’ll win.”
Volkov and Hardy will co-headline UFC Moscow on November 9th. Headlining the event is a featherweight tiff between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar.
