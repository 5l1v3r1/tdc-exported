Andre Gomes has thanked people who have sent him well wishes as he recovers at home following ankle surgery.
The 26-year-old Everton midfielder suffered a fracture-dislocation to his right ankle during the club’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Sunday.
He had an operation on Monday, which was said to have gone “extremely well”, and on Wednesday the Portugal international provided his first public comments since the incident.
