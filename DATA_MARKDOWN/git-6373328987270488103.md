        A professional Fortnite player has received a lifetime ban from playing the video game after he was caught cheating.
      
Jarvis Kaye, who has nearly 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, opened up to his fans in an emotional video post yesterday, November 3, in which he explained the events leading up to his ban.
The 17-year-old YouTuber revealed he had been uploading videos that showed him using aimbots in the game to improve the accuracy of his shooting, but said he was unaware that such actions would lead to a ban.
