Numerous social media users have shared a photo of a Turkish T-155 Fırtına self-propelled howitzer that was allegedly destroyed by a Metis-M anti-tank missile system, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported on Tuesday.
According to the Russian newspaper, the vehicle was hit by a missile during clashes between the Turkish Army and Kurdish-led militia in northern Syria.
