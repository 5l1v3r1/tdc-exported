According to the Togo Navy, the kidnapped crew members include two Filipinos, one Greek and one Georgian.
The navy stated that the tanker was guarded by armed personnel, one of whom was wounded during a shoot-out.
On Saturday, a similar incident occurred near neighbouring Benin as pirates attacked a Norwegian-flagged boat, abducting nine Filipino crew members.
