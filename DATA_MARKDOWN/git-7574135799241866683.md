Mercyful Fate bassist Timi Hansen has passed away at the age of 61. King Diamond confirmed the news in a post on Facebook, writing, “I just found out that I lost one of my dearest friends, who has been fighting cancer for a long time, in such an incredibly brave way. He was not just my roommate on the early Mercyful Fate tours, but he was always my favorite bass player of all times. I was fortunate to have been able to visit him at his apartment with some other good friends, and we had a great afternoon that will never be forgotten. When I last talked to Timi on the phone on October 24th, I could understand that things had gotten tougher than they ever were, and yet he said ‘we fight on.’ I feel so so sad for his entire family, you have my absolute deepest sympathy. Rest in Peace my dear dear friend.”
Hansen revealed he’d been battling cancer after questions arose about why he wouldn’t be part of Mercyful Fate’s 2020 reunion tour. “It’s my big dream to be on stage again playing the old Mercyful Fate numbers in front of all of you very loyal fans,” he wrote at the time.
Rest in peace, Timi.
