The Super Smash Bros. Ultimate news just keeps on coming! On top of all of today's Terry-based excitement (including the now-live Version 6.0 update), we also have more news concerning upcoming amiibo.
That's right, both Dark Samus and Richter have been officially unveiled. The amiibo will be hitting store shelves early next year on 17th January, following on from this month's release of Simon, Chrom and Incineroar.
