        "That happened to me at a very young age, so that was a bit hard."
      
Taylor Swift has opened up on how she was “slut-shamed” in her twenties after a string of high-profile romances with the likes of Harry Styles and Tom Hiddleston.
The singer, who released her seventh album ‘Lover’ in August, explained how it was “hard” to deal with criticism surrounding her personal life.
“When I was like 23 and people were just kind of reducing me to, kind of making slideshows of my dating life and putting people in there that I’d sat next to at a party once and deciding that my songwriting was like a trick rather than a skill and a craft,” she told Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 show.
