Fresh from his victory over Nate Diaz whom he vanquished via a TKO at the UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden, mixed martial artist Jorge Masvidal revealed what he might do to Conor McGregor if their paths cross in the octagon in the future.
During his post-fight press conference, Masvidal mused about the prospects of his future fights and, when reminded about McGregor’s upcoming return, explained how a bout between the two of them would go.
Jorge then went on to make more unflattering remarks about McGregor, saying that he understands why some people “want to see him hurt for the stunts he’s been pulling”.
A number of social media users seemed to agree with Masvidal’s assessment of McGregor.
