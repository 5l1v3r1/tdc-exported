Political parties have been warned that the data regulator will be watching over their General Election campaigning activity to ensure it stays within the law.
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has written to 13 main parties explaining that complying with personal data protection and electronic marketing laws is essential to trust and confidence in the democratic system.
“People expect their personal information to be used in line with the law, and, where that doesn’t happen in digital campaigning, there’s a danger that public trust and confidence in the broader democracy process is damaged,” Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in the letter.
“It’s crucial that candidates and campaigners get this right, and the ICO will be monitoring the situation throughout.”
