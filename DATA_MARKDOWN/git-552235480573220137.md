Police have swooped on the office of Liberal Democrats' leader Jo Swinson after a suspicious package was found.
Officers rushed to the parliamentary office of the East Dunbartonshire MP at around 10am on Monday, November 4.
Sources told the Mirror that the office and staff at her Westminster office were quarantined while police continued to carry out checks.
It is believed that the Lib Dem leader was not in the building at the time of the discovery.
 
A spokesperson for the Met Police said: “ Police were called at approximately 09:51hrs on Monday, 4 November to reports of a suspicious package delivered to Portcullis House, Westminster .
"Officers are in attendance and the contents of the package are being assessed.
"No reports of any illness or injuries. The premises have not been evacuated. Enquiries continue.”
Packages delivered to Parliament are security screened and scares over suspicious parcels are not uncommon.
A House of Commons spokeswoman confirmed: "We are aware of an incident on the Parliamentary Estate which is being managed by the police."
