"Bee-too, Bet-oh, Bay-toe, real name Robert Francis O’Rourke, you can call him a lot of names but Mr. President is not one of them," Tomi Lahren said on Fox Nation's "No Interruption."
Discussing the latest on former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's recent decision to withdraw from the 2020 presidential race, Lahren said she felt "a little bit safer thanks to the good news."

"Folks, the second amendment, the Constitution, and our great nation are a little bit safer this week thanks to this news. Yes, Robert Francis O’Rourke has dropped out of the presidential race. Now we know that great sense of relief Texans felt when they dodged that bullet in 2018," Lahren said.
On Friday, the Texas Democrat announced his official withdrawal from the 2020 presidential race, telling supporters “it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully."
