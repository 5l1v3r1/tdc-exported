Chinese manufacturing giant, Huawei, has been at loggerheads with the US on multiple issues. The US has always told its allies to desist from Huawei’s 5G. It believes that Huawei’s 5G is not safe and has backdoors. Some weeks ago, reports out of Germany claims that the German government will allow Huawei to participate in its 5G construction. In response to the reports, the US said that if Germany allows Huawei to participate in its 5G network construction, it will reassess its intelligence sharing with Germany. Now, a recent report claims that the German intelligence agency (BND) expresses concerns over Huawei’s 5G.
According to BND, there should be a clear political assessment of the possible risks for the development of 5G. German intelligence agency (BND) accuses Huawei of having direct contact with the Chinese government. It even believes that the company may have a state ownership status. Therefore, one could not trust Huawei. This recent development is putting a dent on Huawei’s hopes in Germany. However, the Chinese manufacturer was quick to defend itself
