BENGALURU: A cheating case has been registered against OYO Hotels & Homes founder Ritesh Agarwal and six others based on a complaint by a hotelier who has alleged that the firm did not pay rent for rooms for the past five months, police said on Monday.
In his complaint, Betz Fernandez, who owns Roxel Inn at Domlur here, stated that OYO had booked rooms and had agreed to pay Rs 7 lakh per month.
The OYO Hotels & Homes said in a statement that they will file a counter complaint against the Bengaluru hotel owner for "using improper legal means to sensationalise a civil dispute and get attention."
