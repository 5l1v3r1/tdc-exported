        A power-sharing deal has been signed between Yemen’s internationally recognized government and southern separatists, in a Saudi-brokered initiative.
      
This power-sharing deal, however, does not put an end to the initial fighting between Houthi rebels and the internationally-recognised government that is still raging on.
Instead, this agreement could quell the unrest that was sparked after secessionist forces took control of Yemen’s interim capital Aden back in August.
The move had distracted the Saudi-led coalition from its fight against the Houthis.
At a televised ceremony in Riyadh on Tuesday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said “this agreement will open a new period of stability in Yemen.”
