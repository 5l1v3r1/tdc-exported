        President Donald Trump has cited ‘unfair economic burden’ on his country as the reason for officially pulling the US out of the Paris agreement on climate change. 
      
The POTUS has long refuted the idea of man-made climate change, having promised back in 2017 to pull the US out of the accords to keep the planet from warming more than 2°C.
The global agreement’s inception was in 2015, with 197 countries signing on – but on Monday, November 4, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the formal process towards withdrawal had begun.
