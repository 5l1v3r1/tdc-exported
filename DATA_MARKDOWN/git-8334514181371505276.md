MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was concerned by Iranâ€™s intention to further scale back its commitment to a 2015 nuclear deal, and that Moscow would like the deal to remain in place.
Iran said on Monday it had launched a new batch of advanced centrifuges to accelerate uranium enrichment, following the withdrawal from the nuclear pact by the United States, and renewed sanctions on Iran, which have harmed its oil exports.
