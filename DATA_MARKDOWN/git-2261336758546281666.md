Last week we reported that an MMA fighter named A Hu knocked out wing chun ‘master’ Ding Hao at a style-vs-style fighting event in China. Apparently this isn’t the first time Hu has done this. It wasn’t even the first time he’d done it that night.
According to Asia One, Hu fought two self-proclaimed kung fu masters that night; Ding Hao and Song De Cai.
For the bout, Song was listed as 5’8”, 176 lbs and 44 years of age. Hu is twenty years younger, a little taller, and weighs 144 lbs. Asia One claims Song is a tai chi practitioner. Whatever Song is trained in it didn’t help him versus Hu, though.
