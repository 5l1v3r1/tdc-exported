        Work has begun on the construction of the home of the 2024 Olympic Games, to be hosted in Paris. The development is part of a broader government plan to reinvigorate the poorest urban area in the country.
      
The Olympic village, which will house some 15,000 athletes and officials, is being built in the Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, part of the urban fringe which has suffered from social tensions and neglect for years.
But the project is controversial locally because it will force the relocation of residents, businesses and even schools in the area where the village is to be constructed.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe launched the works, which are set to last over three years, in the suburb of Saint-Ouen.
After the games the authorities plan to reconfigure the area into a new neighbourhood that will offer a total of 3,000 homes and also increase local participation in sports.
"If we want the Games to be a success, we must make sure that all this organisation, all this financing and this mobilisation does not just vanish when the Olympic flame goes out," said Philippe as he launched the works.
"It needs to last," he added.
