        New Delhi (Sputnik): India has vowed to ban single-use plastics by 2022. Currently, the per capita consumption of plastic in the country is 11-kg per year, and it generates 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste yearly. While 60 per cent of this is recycled, the rest ends up in rivers, oceans and landfills.
      
Students in India took to the streets of Chandigarh city, dressed as Draculas and zombies in costumes fashioned out of discarded plastic bottles and bags with their faces painted with fake blood and make-up, to increase awareness about the demons of single-use plastic that haunt the environment.
