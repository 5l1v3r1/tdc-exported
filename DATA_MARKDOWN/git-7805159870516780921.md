Earlier today, Xiaomi unveiled its latest entry in the ultra-popular Mi Note series: the Xiaomi Mi Note 10. There are actually two phones in this series, the standard Note 10 and the Mi Note 10 Pro. These devices are destined to be very popular, so we’ve opened up the forums for users to jump in.
The main difference between the two phones is that the non-Pro model has a 7 piece lens setup, while the Pro model uses 8. The Pro model also has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Otherwise, you’re looking at two phones with 6.47-inch OLED displays, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G, 5260 mAh batteries, and a bunch of cameras. The Mi Note 10 has been priced at €549 (~$608) for the 6GB/128GB variant, while the Mi Note 10 Pro has been priced at €649 (~$719) for the 8GB/256GB variant.
