A wreath was laid in memory of Calgary Herald journalist Michelle Lang at a sunrise flag-raising ceremony on Wednesday.
Lang was 34 years old when she was killed in action on Dec. 30, 2009 while reporting on the war in Afghanistan. She and four Canadian soldiers died when their armoured vehicle struck an improvised explosive device on the outskirts of Kandahar.
The Vancouver-born reporter was two weeks into a six-week assignment reporting on Canadaâ€™s role in the Afghanistan War when she died. Lang was the only Canadian journalist killed in the war.
Her remains were given the same treatment as the four soldiers who died with her in the blast when they were brought back to Canada. Her flag-draped coffin arrived by military plane and was transported down the stretch of Highway 401 in Ontario known as the Highway of Heroes.
Calgary Herald editor-in-chief Lorne Motley was among those on hand Wednesday morning for the flag raising. The Field of Crosses, located on Memorial Drive, is an annual display of over 3,600 crosses representing the men and women from southern Alberta who died while on active military duty.
