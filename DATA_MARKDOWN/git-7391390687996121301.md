On Nov. 1, Apple TV+ officially launched, offering a handful of original series helmed by high-profile celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, and more. But it's not enough just to own an Apple device, if you want to access all of this new content. In order to use Apple TV+ and watch its new series, you're going to have to do a tiny bit of work â€” but it will likely take a minute or less.
According to Apple, how you activate and watch Apple TV+ depends on the device you're using. If you're using it on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, then all you have to do is download the Apple TV app. If you're watching it on a computer, then you can go to TV.Apple.com using an internet browser. And if you're watching it on a television, then you can watch it through an Apple TV streaming box, the Amazon Fire TV, a Roku streaming player, or a select handful of Samsung TVs with the Apple TV app.
As USA Today reported, Apple TV+ will be available on other smart TVs in the near future, including Sony, LG, and Visio. But it's not just about having the right app or website link: you're also going to have to create a subscription account.
