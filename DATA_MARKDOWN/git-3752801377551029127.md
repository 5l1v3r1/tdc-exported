Tributes were pouring in on Wednesday for trail runner and animal lover Wesley Sweetnam who was killed in an apparent house robbery in Noordhoek, Cape Town. 
"Along with Wesley's endurance and astonishing talent, he was known for his soft heart, big smile and even bigger personality," said company K-Way. 
Sweetnam was one of the company's ambassadors, and was famous for his trail running, including the Otter Run.
