        It's a warts-and-all look at life in the band.
      
Brockhampton have shared a snippet from their forthcoming web docuseries Keeping the Band.
From the brief clip, it appears that the show will provide an unfiltered look at life within the hip-hop band, with footage of live performances being contrasted against dramatic backstage rows.
“Y’all ain’t performing like performers right now. Y’all don’t look like performers out here. What are you doing?” bandleader Kevin Abstract remonstrates at one point in the clip.
Another moment shows the band interacting with their fans, as one runs up to Abstract and tells him during a hug: “My spam account is called kevinabstractisgay.”
