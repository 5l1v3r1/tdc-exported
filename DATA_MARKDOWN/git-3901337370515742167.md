Kaizer Chiefs will host Maritzburg United at a venue other than the FNB Stadium later this month.
Amakhosi will lock horns with the Team Of Choice in the semi-finals of the TKO competition, after the FIFA break on November 24, where the Soweto side are set to take the encounter to the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
However, before then, the first semi-final between Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows will take place at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on November 23, with kick-off times for both clashes set for 15h00.
All four sides will have just under a week to prepare for the semi-finals with the FIFA break set to be underway after this weekend’s Absa Premiership action.
