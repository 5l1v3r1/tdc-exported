Best Buy has a ton of great Black Friday deals for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 games, as well as Xbox One consoles. There’s also a lot of 4K TVs for sale, if you’re in the market for a shiny new TV.
Best Buy’s Black Friday ad preview went out today, showing off a multitude of 4K TVs like the 70-inch Samsung Smart 4K TV with HDR for $549.99, down from $899.99. There’s also a dope PlayStation 4 bundle that includes God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and The Last of Us Remastered for $299.99. If you don’t own any of those games, that’s a steal.
We put some of the best Black Friday deals down below, but there’s many more on the Best Buy website. We’ll be updating this post with the freshest deals as they pop up, too.
