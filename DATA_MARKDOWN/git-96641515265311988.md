Apple has offered a look at one of its first few TV+ movies with a trailer for The Banker. The drama stars Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nia Long, and Nicholas Hoult.
Based on a true story, The Banker tells the tale of Bernard Garr and Joe Morris, respectively played by Mackie and Jackson (who are teaming back up after their Marvel Cinematic Universe exploits). The entrepreneurs developed a bold plan to create a real estate and finance empire during the '50s and '60s, with the aim of helping other African Americans pursue the American dream.
