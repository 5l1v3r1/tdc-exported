Yamaha has showcased the MT-125 at the EICMA 2019 after unveiling it recently in the European market. The MT-125 is a direct competition to the KTM 125 Duke in Europe and will provide an additional option for the European A1 license holders.
From the design standpoint, the Yamaha MT-125 takes its entire styling inspiration from the MT-15. The motorcycle gets an aggressive front face with an LED projector headlamp and twin LED pilot lamps. It also features an aggressive fuel tank design with tank extension, a single piece seat for the comfort of the rider, and a sleek tail section.
The MT-125 shares its full digital LCD instrument cluster with the MT-15. While the Indian spec MT-15 uses conventional telescopic forks at the front and a box-section swingarm, the European spec MT-125 gets a 41mm upside-down fork at the front and a cast aluminium swingarm.
