Red Dead Redemption 2 was officially released for the PC yesterday and, it’s pretty safe to say at this point, that the launch is proving to be something of an unmitigated disaster. While some users have been able to play the game without seemingly any problems, they are the lucky few.
Why? Well, a huge number of people can’t even get the game to load up even nearly 24-hours after it officially ‘came out’.
At present, those experiencing problems largely fall into two camps. Those who are having the Rockstar Games Launcher itself crash when attempting to launch the game and those who have the game crash at the load-up screen. For those who are actually able to access the game, however, they also are reporting a number of issues including permanent loading screens and graphical/audio glitches.
The good news is that if you have been experiencing launch problems, a new update to the Rockstar Games Launcher may allow you to finally play the game. The bad news is, even this fix isn’t working for everyone!
