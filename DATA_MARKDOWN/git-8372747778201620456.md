FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Motorists are being warned of two overnight road closures along a section of Alico Road east of Interstate 75 this weekend.
According to the Lee County Government, crews will need to replace drainage pipes across the road as part of the Alico Road Widening Project.
As a result, Alico Road will be completely closed from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. on the nights of Friday, November 1 and Saturday, November 2.
The affected segment is between Ben Hill Griffin Parkway and Airport Haul Road. That's just east of Gulf Coast Town Center.
