Today's contest puts a Blu-ray copy of Hobbs & Shaw up for grabs!
I think I watched the first three Fast & Furious movies, but lost track somewhere around Fast & Furious in Space 2. They've really made a lot of those movies at this point. The good news is, they've embraced the full-on action aspects of the whole thing and actually look like a really good time, these days.
So, they're already on spin-offs! For what it's worth, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are great, and look like they have a ton of chemistry in this one. So, give Hobbs & Shaw a chance and enjoy some good old-fashioned, action-oriented car porn!
