Former Gloucester chairman Ryan Walkinshaw has congratulated Premiership Rugby for “finally bringing this club [Saracens] to justice”.
The reigning Gallagher Premiership and European champions were docked 35 league points and fined £5.36million on Tuesday for breaching the salary cap regulations governing the game in England.
The businessman, whose father and former chairman Tom was instrumental in the introduction of the salary cap, had been vocal in the past about clubs that try and skirt around the salary cap, likening it to taking performance-enhancing drugs.
He took to Twitter to accuse Saracens of “systematic cheating over a long period of time. Finally the fans know the truth”.
He also congratulated the journalists from the UK Daily Mail, who ensured that this issus  was investigated and not simply ignored by Premiership Rugby.
