        Ireland have qualified for next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo after defeating Canada 4-3 in a dramatic penalty shootout at Energia Park.
      
The pair met this evening in Dublin 4 after yesterday’s first-leg finished goalless at the Donnybrook venue meaning tonight’s encounter was a winner takes all clash.
After 60 minutes of action, the tie remained scoreless meaning it was going to take a penalty shootout to decide who was going forward to compete at Tokyo 2020.
Gill Pender, last year’s World Cup penalty shootout hero, missed Ireland’s first attempt as memories of the 2015 nightmare in Valencia began to flood the minds.
