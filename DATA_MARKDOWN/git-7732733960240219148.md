The news came in a live steam held to discuss the merger with Sprint that the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) just approved on Tuesday. Legere said the company was working hard toward meeting the commitments that it made to the FCC and to consumers.
Approval of the deal came with conditions that must be met. For one, the provider must have 5G service to at least 97 percent of its customers within the next three years. It must also deliver 100Mbps or faster speeds to 90 percent of its subscribers by 2025. The company could face as much as $2 billion in fines if it does not meet those milestones.
“We have made tangible, significant commitments to the federal government about all that we are going to do with serious penalties on behalf of the shareholders of this company if we do not perform," said Legere.
