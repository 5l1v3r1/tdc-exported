Frank Ocean debuted an unreleased and untitled Skepta collaboration at one of his PrEP+ parties last night – see a clip of it below.
Hosting a special Halloween edition of PrEP+ last night (October 31), those in attendance were treated to a full preview of a new song that hears the ‘Blonde’ singer-songwriter team up with Skepta.
Ocean previously teased the untitled song by sharing a snippet of it on his Instagram Story last year, but at last night’s event in New York – which was cohosted by Arca – the song was played in full to a packed club at Knockdown Center’s BASEMENT.
Watch a clip of the collaboration being previewed below:
