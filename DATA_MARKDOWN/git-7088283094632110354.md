        French foie gras producers have shrugged off a decision by the city of New York to ban the controversial delicacy made from the livers of force-fed ducks and geese, saying their access to the US market is already barred by sanitary rules.
      
New York city council voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to ban the sale of the French delicacy from 2022, on the grounds that force-feeding is a cruel practice.
"I am astounded that the country of the Statue of Liberty and liberalism can ban the consumption of a product that is healthy and sells well," said Marie-Pierre PÃ©, director of the interprofessional committee of foie gras producers in France.
"It's a symbol of French gastronomy which is being targeted. But there is nothing like a ban to boost sales," she added.
