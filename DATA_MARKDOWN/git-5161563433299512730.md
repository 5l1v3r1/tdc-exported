VANCOUVER - Notable B.C. resident Pamela Anderson is drawing heavy criticism online after posting photos of herself posing in a feathered headdress.
Anderson tweeted the photos Thursday afternoon with the caption "Happy Halloween." Since then, more than 500 tweets have been sent in response, many of them criticizing her for appropriating Indigenous culture.
"This is really disappointing and racist Pam, I thought you were better than this," wrote one user, who went on to describe warbonnets as sacred and earned.
"Culture isn't a costume, it's not disposable, it's not an aesthetic," the user wrote.
