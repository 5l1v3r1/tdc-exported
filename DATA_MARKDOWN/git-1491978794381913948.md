        Greenwald has faced backlash from far right after series of articles damaging to Jair Bolsonaro’s government
      
Brazil’s bitterly divided politics reached a new low on Thursday, when a rightwing columnist smacked the US journalist Glenn Greenwald in the face on a live radio program.
Greenwald and Augusto Nunes are prominent figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but Thursday’s physical violence – which was being livestreamed – left Brazilians stunned.
Greenwald has become a central figure in Brazilian politics after publishing a string of articles challenging the legitimacy of the country’s largest-ever corruption investigation.
His reporting – based on a trove of leaked mobile phone messages – has been particularly damaging for the government of Jair Bolsonaro, making Greenwald a hate figure for those on Brazil’s far right, who have accused him of illegal hacking.
The altercation came when the two men appeared on a program for the Jovem Pan radio station on Thursday.
Nunes, a well-known columnist for Veja magazine, had previously suggested that a family judge should look into taking away Greenwald’s adopted children.
Referring to Nunes’s comments, Greenwald said: “What he did was the ugliest, dirtiest thing I have seen in my career as a journalist.”
Nunes responded that he was merely asking who took care of Greenwald’s children while his husband – the congressman David Miranda – was in the capital and the journalist was “spending all his time dealing with stolen material”.
