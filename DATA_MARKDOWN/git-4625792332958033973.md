Turkey said it captured the sister of dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi during a raid in northern Syria.
A senior Turkish official told Reuters that Rasmiya Awad, 65, her husband, and her daughter-in-law were detained Monday and are being interrogated. Awad was with five children when she was captured, the official said.
“We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of ISIS,” the official said.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director said the arrest of the woman proved Turkey was committed to fighting ISIS.
“The arrest of al-Baghdadi’s sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations,” Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter early on Tuesday.
“Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh,” he wrote, using another name for the terror group. “Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned.”
