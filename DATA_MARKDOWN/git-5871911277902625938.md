The Panthers had hoped to get Cam Newton back at some point this season, but the foot injury he suffered in Week 2 is preventing that from happening.
Even though he’s been on top of his rehab, Newton’s foot simply hasn’t improved enough to make a return possible, and the star quarterback has now gone out in search of answers. According to ESPN’s Josina Anderson, Newton boarded a plane to Green Bay on Friday to visit a foot specialist.
