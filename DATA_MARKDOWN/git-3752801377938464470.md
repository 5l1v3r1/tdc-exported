A sinkhole on both sections of the R50 leading to Delmas, Pretoria has led to the road's closure, and motorists have been urged to find alternative routes. 
Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport spokesperson Melitah Madiba said the precautionary measure was due to the road surface continuing to deteriorate as a result of the sinkhole.
"This after the department discovered the formation of a sinkhole depression on the R50/Delmas Road during routine maintenance. The steep gradient was temporarily filled for easy passage, with cracks being monitored and recorded daily. 
"The road is closed from an intersection at Elandsfontein Road as well as another intersection linking the R50 and R25. Access will be given to residents only," Madiba said.
