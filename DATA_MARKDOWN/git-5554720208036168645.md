Singer Sona Mohapatra has once again targeted cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and industrialist Anand Mahindra days after she took her #MeToo fight against Sony TV global. In her latest social post, Sona also accused Sony TV of using the public praise for Indian Idol contestants by Tendulkar and Mahindra for PR exercise. She asked both the public icons to take a stand ‘on the right side of history.’
In her latest tweet, Sona wrote that a troll army had been unleashed on her for questioning Tendulkar’s decision to praise Indian Idol contestants in light of Sony TV hiring a MeToo accused judge, Anu Malik. She wrote, “I am experiencing a troll army that has been unleashed by diverting the issue at hand-reinstating a sexual offender as judge on National TV to me supposedly ‘lashing’ out at Sachin Tendulkar for praising ‘bechara lachar’ contestants & making this ‘news’.Sony TV, PR machinery I C U.”
