In recent years, Google has strived to make its products work better internationally. Google News for Android and iOS now supports bilingual feeds to show stories for up to two “languages & regions of interest.”
This new capability allows your News feed to be populated with articles from an additional language, as well as what the app calls “region of interest.” This is touted as allowing you to “learn more about a culture or to catch up on what’s going on elsewhere.”
The new language will benefit from your “previous personalization preferences,” so all content surfaced should be relevant for you.
Bilingual feed support is already rolled out to Google News for Android and iOS in 141 countries and 41 language options. Start by tapping your profile image in the upper-right corner > Settings > Languages & regions of interest > Add a language and region. One pairing can be set as the “primary” in order to “see more from here.”
