When asked on Monday if she will “stop U.S.-supported murder” as president, candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, “I like your frame on this.”
Warren, D-Mass., made the comment Monday in a town hall at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, where she addressed a crowd of hundreds of students, faculty members and residents.
During the town hall, a man identified as Isaiah is heard saying, “The office of the president also has an amazing responsibility to people outside of the United States given the power and position, and right now the United States is bombing at least seven countries.”
“We support genocides in Palestine and in Yemen. The U.S. military is actually the biggest polluter of any organization in the world, and we also work in more clandestine ways,” he said.
“Columbia economist Jeffrey Sachs reported that between 2017 and 2018, United States sanctions on Venezuela caused over 40,000 deaths. And we also have sanctions on many other countries like Iran, North Korea, and you can name many more.

“So, I’m wondering, as president, will you stop U.S.-supported murder, whether it’s through sanctions, arms support or boots on the ground?”
Warren then immediately responded by saying, “So, I like your frame on this.”
