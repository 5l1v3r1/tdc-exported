        Greta Thunberg is calling on boat owners to help her get back across the Atlantic Ocean after the COP25 Climate Summit was moved from Chile to Madrid.

The climate change activist spent two weeks travelling from Britain to New York earlier this year, when she opted to travel in a sailing boat rather than a plane due to the carbon emissions involved in aviation.
Her trip paid off as she made waves – pun intended – at the UN Climate Summit, where she called out world leaders and demanded they take action in a passionate speech. However, the activist has now found herself needing to get back across the pond.

The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP25, was set to take place in Santiago, Chile, next month, but the country abandoned plans to host due to deadly anti-government protests taking place.
Around 25,000 delegates were expected to travel to Santiago for the event but on Friday, November 1, the UN revealed COP25 would be held in Spain instead.
Following the announcement, Greta took to Twitter to ask her followers for help getting back across the Atlantic to attend the event.
