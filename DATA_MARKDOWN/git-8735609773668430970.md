MONTREAL – The Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) lost a vote on a motion presented by the opposition Wednesday evening to cancel the government’s reform to a fast-track immigration policy for graduates.
Only three of the party’s members were present at the National Assembly at the time of the vote.
The rest of the team, including Premier François Legault, was at a fundraiser to support the party's candidate in the upcoming Jean-Talon riding byelection, according to opposition parties.
“The whip didn’t know that we have to have five MNAs to ask to [delay the vote],” the premier said Thursday, adding that the vote doesn't change a thing.
“I would like to have a vote today, unfortunately it’s too late, and you’ll see 75 people vote against this motion.”
As it stands, the CAQ has 75 seats at the National Assembly, giving it a comfortable majority. The Quebec Liberals have 28; Quebec Solidaire has 10; the Parti Québécois has nine, there are two independent seats and one vacant position.
