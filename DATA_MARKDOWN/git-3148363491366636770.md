When confronted in Illinois, Durbin told the Indian contract workers on Sunday that he wants more foreign workers hired in American workplaces:
Durbin is blocking Lee’s S.386 bill because he wants to put even more Indian contract workers on a fast track to citizenship — and he also wants to more than double legal immigration from one million to roughly 2.6 million per year for several years. That huge inflow would add two million immigrants to compete for decent jobs against the four million Americans who turn 18 each year.
The huge inflow would expand the economy and boost investors — but would also shrink the per-capita income of American employees and their families.
