Emily Maitlis has said her “heart goes out” to colleague Samira Ahmed during her employment tribunal.
The Newsnight presenter voiced her support for the Newswatch host, who is pursuing an equal pay complaint against the BBC.
Maitlis said the issue of pay equality is not confined to the BBC and is an international problem.
Ahmed claimed during her tribunal that she was paid “a sixth” of what Jeremy Vine earned while he was presenting Points Of View.
Maitlis, speaking on Good Morning Britain, said salary issues are not limited to Vine, or the much-discussed earnings of Gary Lineker, and that broader injustices should be tackled.
She said: “As somebody who’s been in a similar position, my heart goes out to her.
“I think it’s a really important thing that she’s doing, fighting for other people who’ve got unjust and unequal imbalances.”
She added: “Presumably it is a nationwide or an international problem that we’re all trying to understand and get to grips with, and whether we need more transparency or not is clearly the big issue.”
