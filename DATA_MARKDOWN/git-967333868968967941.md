        'A Warning’, a book by an anonymous author who describes themselves as a "senior Trump administration official", is scheduled to be published on 19 November and offers "a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record".
      
The US Justice Department, in a letter to the Hachette Book Group, publisher of 'A Warning', is seeking to reveal details about the anonymous author,  described as a "senior Trump administration official," according to Fox News. The DoJ letter reportedly warns that the author may be subject to a breach in their nondisclosure agreements.
The letter further explained that nondisclosure agreements ordinarily impose pre-publication revisions of written work that could be “potentially containing protected information”.
The Hachette Book Group, which confirmed receiving the assistant attorney general’s letter, announced that it would not reveal the identity of the author, Fox News reported.
The writer of an op-ed titled "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration," published on 5 September 2018 by the New York Times, promised to continue uncovering the Trump administration by writing a book that would be published in November 2019.
"This explosive book offers a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record," the publishing company reportedly said in a press release earlier this year.
