Pelosi told a news conference: “I remain a staunch and ardent supporter of the McDermott-Conyers bill.”
She was referring to H.R. 1200 of the 103rd Congress, the “American Health Security Act of 1993,” which proposed a “single-payer,” government-run health insurance system.
The bill was introduced in the House by Reps. John Conyers (D-MI) and Jim McDermott (D-WA), and in the Senate by the late liberal stalwart Paul Wellstone (D-MN).
One version of the 1993 C-SPAN clip appears to have been generated in 2017, but resurfaced this weekend, after Pelosi criticized the “Medicare for All” plan proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), which would cost $52 trillion.
