        Bitcoin has spent another day in consolidation following a roller-coaster ride last month. This year has had similar ups and downs in terms of BTC price but fundamentally the network is going from strength to strength.
      
In terms of price, BTC has spent another day trading within its range in the low $9,000s. Tradingview charts report that it has climbed from $9,100 to $9,250 over the past few hours adding 1.5% on the day. There is nothing really to report as the range-bound trading has continued.
The fact that there has been no massive dump following last weekendâ€™s impressive rally is bullish. Further gains could be on the cards in the short term. In the longer term, they are virtually guaranteed as a number of positive factors are coming into play.
Co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, Anthony Pompliano, has observed this brewing of bitcoin bullishness in a recent tweet.
