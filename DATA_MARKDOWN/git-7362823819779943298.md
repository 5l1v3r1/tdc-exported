After “Saturday Night Live” mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s $52 trillion “Medicare-for-all" plan, former CEO of CKE Restaurants Andy Puzder said that the presidential hopeful has no understanding of how interrelated the economy is.
“Her plan is ridiculous, it’s a fantasy, it’s unachievable, you couldn’t pass it. If you did pass it, it would tank the economy, it’s absurd,” Puzder, the author of “Capitalist Comeback,” told “Fox & Friends” on Monday.
There’s so much about this plan that would be so devastating for the American people and I think people are smart enough to know that. The 'Saturday Night Live' people certainly are.”
