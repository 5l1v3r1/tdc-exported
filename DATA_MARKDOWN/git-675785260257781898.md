Top Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg today issued a grovelling apology after making "disgraceful" and "insensitive" comments about the Grenfell Tower fire.
The Leader of the Commons had been condemned by victims' families after saying the “common sense” reaction would be ignore 'Stay Put' advice and flee a fire.
In comments reported by the Evening Standard, Mr Rees Mogg said: “I profoundly apologise.
“What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade’s advice to stay and wait at the time. However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn’t and I don’t think anyone else would.
“What’s so sad is that the advice given overrides common sense because everybody would want to leave a burning building.
 
“I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments. With hindsight and after reading the report no one would follow that advice. That’s the great tragedy.”
