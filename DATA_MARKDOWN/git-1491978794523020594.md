I photographed this nomad boy and his family’s goat near Litang, a major centre of Tibetan culture. With an elevation of nearly 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) it has a subarctic climate characterised by long, cold winters, and short summers. These goats produce fine cashmere wool highly prized for clothing and textiles.

I photographed this novice monk studying Buddhist writings in the late afternoon at a monastery in Aranyaprathet, near the Thai border with Cambodia. I watched the changing light as the monks went about both the mundane and sacred duties of their day. With the simple use of wood and fabric, of shades of saffron from mustard gold to deep orange, their environment was serene.
