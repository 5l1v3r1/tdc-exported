Chelsea racked up a fifth successive Premier League victory with a 2-1 success at Watford, whose winless start to the season has entered club-record territory.
Frank Lampard’s men are enjoying an impressive campaign and earned the three points at Vicarage Road thanks to goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic.
Abraham bagged his 10th of the season in all competitions in just the fifth minute and Pulisic’s fourth in two league games after the break sealed the win that sends Chelsea back into third place.
They are just two points behind second-placed Manchester City and eight behind leaders Liverpool as their young and vibrant team continue to exceed expectations this term.
For Watford, it was the familiar taste of defeat and the 11 games they have gone without a win so far is the worst start to a league campaign in their history.
Gerard Deulofeu’s penalty, awarded by VAR after a lengthy checking process, set up a grandstand finish, but in truth had it not been for Ben Foster’s heroics in goal, the Hornets could have been looking at a defeat similar to the 8-0 mauling they suffered at Manchester City earlier in the campaign.
