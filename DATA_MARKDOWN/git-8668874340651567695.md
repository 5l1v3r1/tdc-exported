Former Wallaby and cricket administrator Pat Howard is part of a three-person panel who will review the Wallabies’ 2019 season following their World Cup flop.
He will be joined by four-time Olympic rower Bo Hanson and 116-test Wallabies forward Nathan Sharpe.
Rugby Australia director Scott Johnson will also work alongside the group to deliver the review over the next month, which will be run separately to the process of appointing a new Wallabies coach.

The review will involve interviewing all test players and staff and encompass the World Cup campaign as well as other internationals.
It will consider coaching, planning, athletic performance, campaign preparation, team cohesion and selection processes.
A former Wallabies playmaker with 20 test caps, Howard led Rugby Australia’s High Performance Unit before joining Cricket Australia in 2011.
His most recent position there was as executive general manager of team performance, responsible for the Australian team’s high-performance unit.
