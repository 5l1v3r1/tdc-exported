After four years in development, Indivisible arrived last month, bringing the combo-heavy combat of certain old-school RPGs into the modern age. It garnered praise across the gaming world, but it soon became clear that there were a few issues holding it back from true greatness, some of which are still waiting to be addressed. Kotaku recently caught up with the Indivisible team to discuss the game’s launch and what’s on the horizon, including changes to levelling, new characters, and more.
Developed by Lab Zero Games, the studio behind cult classic Skullgirls, Indivisible features a number of gameplay elements that seem more at home in fighting games – juggle combos, throw breaks, high-low mixups – than an RPG, even one inspired by the genre-bucking Valkyrie Profile. Creative director Mariel Cartwright says responses to the game have been generally positive, even if some expected more fundamental RPG mechanics to play a larger role.
“Indivisible is kinda in a new category,” Cartwright told Kotaku via email. “We were aiming to make a game with RPG elements, like a large cast of playable characters and an involved story, but also evoke that tense, action-y feeling that platformers and fighting games are so good at creating. Turns out, though, that associating the game with ‘RPG’ as a genre led to a lot of people assuming it would be closer to a traditional JRPG – e.g., lots of items, stats, equipment, and grinding – and those people definitely ended up being the most vocally disappointed, because it simply isn’t that type of game.”
