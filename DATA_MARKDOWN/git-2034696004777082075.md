        Rodney Reed is set to be executed on November 20.
      
Rihanna and T.I. have backed efforts to stop the upcoming execution of Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed.
Reed has been incarcerated for more than 21 years for the 1996 rape and murder of Stacey Stites, but he is scheduled to be executed on November 20 despite continually protesting his innocence.
Mr Reed was convicted in 1998 and reportedly had a sexual relationship with Ms Stites. Fresh evidence now suggests that her fiancee, former police officer Jimmy Fennel, may have been the real culprit.
Posting on Twitter, Rihanna shared a petition that urges Texas Governor Greg Abbott to halt the execution, which is scheduled for 20 November.
“One Click!!! SIGN this petition if you don’t believe the Government should kill an innocent man!!! @GovAbbott,” she wrote.
