Boris Johnson has challenged Jeremy Corbyn to “come clean” about where he stands on Brexit as he accused the UK Labour leader of wanting to “go back to square one”.
In a letter to Mr Corbyn, the British Prime Minister said voters deserve to have a “clear picture” of what each potential leader will do when it comes to leaving the European Union.
Mr Johnson said Mr Corbyn has “sought to avoid explaining” what his plan is and has instead “spent considerable time and energy seeking to undermine the negotiations”.
The letter, sent to Mr Corbyn tonight, includes five questions which Mr Johnson says he and the voting public await answers to, and comes ahead of a speech from Mr Corbyn tomorrow in which he is expected to set out his Brexit plan.
Mr Johnson wrote: “Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one.
“You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends, and instead negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch.
“Even assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do – under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit.
