Amber Luke, 24, from Central Coast, New South Wales, Australia, spent 40 minutes in the chair during the excruciating procedure, risking going permanently blind in order to achieve her perfect look.
With 200 tattoos from head to toe, breast augmentation, cheek and lip fillers as well as pointed implants placed in her ears, Amber is no stranger to cosmetic surgery pain.

Despite her previous commitments to body modification, Amber says the eyeball inking was the last of her ‘extreme’ modifications, but does still plan to be ‘fully covered’ by March 2020.
Speaking previously to Daily Mail Australia, Amber described the procedure as ‘very intense and very painful’, with her eyes being held open as a syringe was injected into each eye four times over.
