The latest instalment of Sega and Nintendo’s Olympics crossover series takes Sonic, Mario, and friends to Tokyo to compete in more than 30 summer sports mini-games. There’s a single-player story mode, online and offline play of single events, and that’s about it. No online or offline tournaments, no creating custom event playlists. Just pick and play. As charming as Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is, it could use more ways to play.
It’s always a good time when Sonic and Mario get together for some friendly competition. Seeing Tokyo landmarks and sports venues with Toads, Shy Guys, and Chao warms my crossover-loving heart. There is something magical about these colourful worlds colliding that’s as delightfully novel as it was when the first Mario and Sonic Olympics game came out on the Wii in 2007. There are 34 sports mini-games this time around, including new retro 2D and futuristic “Dream” events, but it’s Mario and Sonic sports mini-games. Even if we’re just tapping a button rapidly to run along a track, it’s better when those guys are involved.
