The November 6 edition of WWE NXT starts out with The O.C. coming out to continue the storyline of Monday Night Raw, Friday Night SmackDown and NXT invading each other as we head to the Survivor Series.
Just before NXT came on the air, The O.C. attacked The Undisputed Era at Full Sail University. However, their promo is interrupted by Tomasso Ciampa, who is joined by Matt Riddle and Keith Lee.
A Six-Man Tag Team Match is set up for later in the night.
