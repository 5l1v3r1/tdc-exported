After a turbulent and not-especially-productive run on RCA Records — or at least productive in the years after she released her great 2014 debut Aquarius — the LA R&B queen Tinashe is now on her own, getting ready to release a new independent album called Songs For You. A couple of weeks ago, she dropped a video for “Die A Little Bit,” a sharp, slinky, clubby track that features the UK rapper Ms Banks. Today, she’s come out with another single, a more traditional R&B number that features the Atlanta singer 6LACK.
Sadly, “Touch & Go” is not an ode to the long-running Midwestern indie label that put out all those Butthole Surfers and Jesus Lizard records. Instead, it’s a slow and emotional just-before-the-breakup song, with both Tinashe and 6LACK playing two people who are trying to figure out whether to keep their relationship together.
