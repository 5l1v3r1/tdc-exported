Safaricom announced VoLTE support in June this year and it was a big deal. VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is a standard that delivers voice and data in the same 4G network eliminating the need to switch to 3G networks. The result is faster phone connections, three times better voice quality and reduced background.
Despite its numerous benefits, VoLTE is not supported by all smartphones. During Safaricom’s initial announcement, they supported a number of smartphones but there was one that was conspicuously missing: iPhones.
Apple added support for VoLTE on iPhones starting with the iPhone 6 so it was odd that it was missing from this list. However, it seems like now it has been quietly supported and it shows up on an Apple’s support page.
Currently, Safaricom is the only carrier in the country where VoLTE is supported in this list.
It seems like it was enabled later on to iPhones and a Safaricom consumer confirmed this by posting this screenshot
