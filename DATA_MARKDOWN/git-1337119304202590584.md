Adobe is previewing a bunch of experimental features that could one day come to its apps, including several that use AI to manipulate images and audio.
The features were revealed during Adobe’s Sneaks event last night at the company’s annual Max creativity conference, and this year, the features made heavy use of the Adobe’s Sensei AI platform. Sneaks is where apps like Adobe Fresco and features like content-aware fill were first previewed, so there’s a good chance that some of these tools may appear in a Creative Cloud app near you in the future.
Comedian John Mulaney hosted the event this year and served as a guinea pig for Adobe’s researchers to demonstrate the new features. Among the experiments was a feature called Go Figure, which automatically tracks a person’s movement and can translate that into quick animations. Check out the videos below to see which features might be worth looking forward to and which ones should make you cower in fear of the growing power of AI. You can also read the Adobe blog for a full list of the features.
