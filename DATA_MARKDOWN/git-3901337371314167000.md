After a crunch encounter against Orlando Pirates, where he was the subject of some harsh tackles, Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat took some time out to unwind. Check it out.
It was his challenge on the Zimbabwean that saw Bucs defender Mthokozisi Dube receive his marching orders.
There was also the infamous stamp on him by Thembinkosi Lorch, which saw ‘Nyoso’ receive a yellow card.
Despite the on field antics, the 29-year-old Zimbabwean headed to a popular chisa nyama spot, Meat Lounge in Sunninghill on Sunday.

 Billiat took to Instagram to share his whereabouts with his followers.
In his story, Billiat can be seen pulling into the spot in his R2 million Range Rover Lumma, which was recently damaged at a car wash.
Fans will be hoping Billiat recuperates in time for their midweek clash, where they will come up against Chippa United.

        Do you think Orlando Pirates players targeted Billiat in Saturday’s TKO Derby?
