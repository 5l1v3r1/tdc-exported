After a long period of trading sideways within the mid-$180 region, Ethereum (ETH) has now begun to incur significant upwards momentum that has pushed it up to $190, which is where it faces some notable resistance that could ultimately push its price lower in the near-term.
Analysts are now noting that this resistance level could halt Ethereumâ€™s rally and possibly lead it to drop significantly lower in the near-term.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up over 2% at its current price of $190, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of $184 that were set during a fleeting sell off experienced by the cryptocurrency yesterday.
It is important to note that Ethereum is currently pushing up against the price level at which it was rejected at in late-October, which sparked a sell-off that sent it down to the lower-$180 region.
This upwards movement has come about while Bitcoin continues to trade sideways in the lower-$9,000 region, which is squarely in the middle of the trading range that it has been caught within for the past several days and weeks.
One interesting fact that should be observed is that the recent ETH rally has been driven by a massive influx of on-chain trading volume, which has surged over 80% in the past 24-hours according to data from TokenAnalyst.
