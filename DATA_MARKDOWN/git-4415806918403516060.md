The Late Late Show's tribute to Gay Byrne has been met with praise and deemed worthy of the legendary broadcaster.
From Mike Murphy to Tommy Tiernan, a host of stars turned out for the one off celebration of Mr Byrne's life.
President Micahel D Higgins opened the tributes saying Mr Byrne was a modern man who, in the 1960s, identified that “aspects of modernity were gradually making their way in” to the country, and he used this to define the conversation.
Former president Mary McAleese said Mr Bryne would have made a great Uachtarán na hÉireann before it was claimed he "was President of Ireland anyway".
