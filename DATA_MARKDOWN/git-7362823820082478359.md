CONCORD, N.H. – Two of the longer-shots for the Democratic presidential nomination are taking aim at some of their middle and top-tier rivals over their health-care proposals.
Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, a centrist candidate who’s long been vocal in his opposition to a government-run “Medicare-for-all” health-care system proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, once again criticized the two progressive standard-bearers among the large field of Democrats seeking the White House.

“You’ve got Senator Sanders and Senator Warren who want to cause complete upheaval to the U.S. health-care system as a way of creating universal health care,” Delaney told reporters on Monday after filing at the New Hampshire secretary of state’s office to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.
Delaney charged that “they’re going to basically blow up 90 percent of the health-care system to try to solve 10 percent.”
