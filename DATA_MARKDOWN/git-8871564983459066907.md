Motorcyclists in Jakarta are often exposed to toxic fumes and air pollution in general (the capital consistently ranks among the worst cities in the world in terms of air quality), yet many still think it’s perfectly acceptable to puff away on their cigarettes while driving. 
One obvious harm that could bring is that hot cigarette ash could endanger motorcyclists driving behind them. In a recent viral video taken on an unspecified road in Jakarta, a motorcyclist with a helmet cam says he got cigarette ash in his eye twice from a smoking motorcyclist who was driving ahead of him.
