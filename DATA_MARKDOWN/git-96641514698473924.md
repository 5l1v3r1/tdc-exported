If you're in the market for a mechanical keyboard, you might want to cast your eye in the direction of the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum. The peripheral can retail for $200, but it's on sale on Amazon now for $130.
The K95 has much in common with Corsair's K70 MK.2 mechanical keyboard, which is selling for $120. For an extra $10, the K95 adds six dedicated macro keys. It also boasts Cherry MX Speed key switches with 1.2-millimeter actuation, 8MB of profile storage for three distinct profiles, an aluminum frame and a lighting bar.
While many gaming-focused mechanical keyboards can be gaudy, the K95 Platinum can be a somewhat tasteful addition to your desk. It's currently the cheapest Amazon has sold the keyboard for, after offering it for the same price for a spell last November, according to price tracking site Camelcamelcamel.
