DURHAM, N.H. – Former two-term Ohio Gov. John Kasich, back in New Hampshire for the first time in the year, mostly – but not entirely – closed the door Thursday on a primary challenge against President Trump.
Kasich, who finished second to Trump in the 2016 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary, said during an event at the University of New Hampshire that he won’t file to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.
“What it looks like for me at this point and time is, there is no path. We’re only eight days away from the filing deadline here and I don’t intend to file because I don’t see a path,” Kasich emphasized during a book-tour stop in the Granite State.
