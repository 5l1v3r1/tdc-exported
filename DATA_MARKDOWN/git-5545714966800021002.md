Arc System Works has dropped its latest character trailer for BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle's Version 2.0 update, which is coming later this month to the crossover anime fighter.The irrepressible Elizabeth is the assistant of the mysterious Velvet Room in Atlus' RPG Persona 3. Typified by her happy-go-lucky, somewhat naive, and regularly goofy personality, Elizabeth is, in reality, a tireless worker and dedicated to the room and its master, Igor. Elizabeth originally took to the ring in Persona 4 Arena, where she fought with an adaptive style based on the moveset of multiple other characters.
