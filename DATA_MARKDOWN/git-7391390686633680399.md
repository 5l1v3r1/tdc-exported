Never say never, Bravo fans, especially when it comes to whether or not Camille Grammer will return to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. On Tuesday, Nov. 5, Camille hinted at her Housewives homecoming when she tweeted, “I’m getting back in the game. diamonds and drama. #rhobh.” The 10th season of RHOBH has been filming since August, so it stands to reason that the series veteran will not be around for the entire season, but will make at least one cameo.
Camille has been a fixture of RHOBH since the beginning— well, almost. With the exception of Season 4, she has been either a main cast member or a Friend Of on every season. By the end of Season 9, she was at odds with almost everyone on the main roster. And then, Camille’s remaining ally on the show, Lisa Vanderpump, exited the series in June, and the rest of the Season 9 cast, AKA the group of people who drove her to walk off the set in the middle of a reunion taping, was reportedly brought back for Season 10. Camille eventually returned to the reunion, but her role as a "Friend Of" on Season 10 no longer felt like a given without LVP around.
