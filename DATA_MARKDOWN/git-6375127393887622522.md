This was confirmed yesterday by Joint Task Force Sulu (JTFS) spokesman Colonel Gerald Monfort.
Monfort identified the arrested ASG member as a certain alias Mang.
Alias Mang was arrested by JTF Sulu at around 6:10 p.m. in Barangay Kan Islam, Indanan, Sulu.
During his arrest, Mang revealed the location of locally assembled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in their safehouse located at  Barangay Paligue, Indanan, Sulu.
Troops from Philippine Army’s 41st Infantry Battalion immediately proceeded to the area and recovered 16 unrigged pipe bombs.
Monfort said the recovered pipe bombs were completely identical to the captured improvised explosives seized from the slain suicide bombers in Bgy. Kan Islam of the same municipality on Tuesday.  
In line with this, Major General Corleto Vinluan Jr, the commander of JTF Sulu, reiterates his gratitude to the Tausug Community who provided timely information regarding the presence of the suicide bombers.
“The successful operations against the terrorists yesterday manifests that Sulu is no longer a haven for ASG bandits and foreign terrorists. With the strong support of the public, I am confident that we will end the problem with the ASG bandits and foreign terrorists in Sulu.” Vinluan said.
