An acclaimed Black author noted for penning one of the first neo-slave narratives, “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” has died.
Ernest Gaines, 86, “rose to prominence through his nine novels and several short stories reflecting the lives of African Americans, Cajuns, and Creoles living in the rural South,” an international research center named in his honor said Tuesday in announcing his death.
