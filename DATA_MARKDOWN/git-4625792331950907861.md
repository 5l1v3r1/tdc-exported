Donald Trump, Jr. joked that Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is his favorite Democrat.
Trump appeared on CBS on Tuesday morning to talk about his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. Host Gayle King attempted to get Trump to compliment a political opponent by asking him to name his favorite Democrat.
The president's son demurred on the question at first. King then began to move the show along to the next segment on the weather when Trump quipped, "Mitt Romney, Gayle. Mitt Romney is my favorite Democrat. How about that?"
After laughing, King wagged her finger at Trump and told him his answer doesnâ€™t count.
