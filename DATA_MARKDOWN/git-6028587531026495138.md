(Updated: 3:23 p.m. EST, 11/7/2019)Topline: Juul stopped sales of its mint nicotine pods Thursday after a National Youth Tobacco survey showed the number of high school students vaping has grown to one in four, while a separate study indicated mint was the number one flavor for that age group.
Big number: Altria said Thursday it’s taking a $4.5 billion write down on its investment in Juul. It invested $12.8 billion in Juul for a 35% stake in 2018.
Key background: Juul has been caught in the middle of public health scares over vaping. Over 2,000 people have been sickened with vaping-related illness, while nearly 40 people have died from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  A number of the cases have been linked with vaping THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Several states, including New York, Michigan, Oregon and Massachusetts have banned e-cigarettes flavors, including those popularized by Juul, to tackle surging use by teenagers and nicotine addiction.
Tangent: Juul said October 28 it would cut 500 jobs by the end of the year, considered by executives as a “necessary reset” following the onslaught of regulatory and legal challenges it faces.
