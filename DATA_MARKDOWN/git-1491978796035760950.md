Party leader says it is ‘entirely feasible’ that more MPs will switch allegiance
A number of Conservative and Labour MPs could be tempted to cross over to the Liberal Democrats if the party makes major gains in the general election, Jo Swinson has predicted at the start of her party’s election campaign.
Speaking to reporters on a party bus taking her on a tour of three Conservative-held seats that the Lib Dems say they have a chance of winning despite coming third in all of them in 2017, Swinson said a significant number of defections was “entirely feasible”.
“I have had MPs from both of those parties say to me that I would be a better prime minister than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn,” the Lib Dem leader said.
