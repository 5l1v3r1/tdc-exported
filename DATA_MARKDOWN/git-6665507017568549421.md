The first India-Bangladesh T20I won’t be cancelled or moved out of Delhi, BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly has clarified amid concerns over growing air pollution. 
A group of environmentalists had written a letter to Ganguly, urging him to consider moving the match outside of Delhi. Care For Air and My Right To Breathe, in the letter, said making the cricketers play in the toxic air will end up doing more damage to their health in the long run and the spectators will also be putting themselves at risk.  
“It’s too late to do anything, because a lot of preparations go into matches like tickets, crowds everything. So it’s not possible to cancel things at the last minute. Fingers crossed,” Ganguly said, according to PTI. He, however, added that they would be more ‘practical’ in the future.
Bangladesh batsman Liton Das was seen wearing a mask during their first practice session ahead of Sunday’s match. He later said he was not feeling well then, according to Hindustan Times. Another report said that three cricketers of the Bangladesh cricket team and a support staff member were spotted wearing masks. 
ANI also shared a video of the practice session:
