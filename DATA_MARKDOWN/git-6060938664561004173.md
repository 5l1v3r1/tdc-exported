Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan have recently completed twenty-eight years of marriage but the couple still manages to give other famous B-town couples like Priyanka Chopra-Nick Jonas, Anushka Sharma-Virat Kohli and others a tough competition.
Not only have the two stood by each other in good and bad but have been giving their fans major relationship goals with their impeccable chemistry.
While Gauri took to social media to share an adorable family picture; SRK reacted to it on Monday afternoon with a sweet message. He shared Gauri's post and wrote, "Over years I made a good house...Gauri made a good Home but I really believe we are the best at making some really good kids!"
