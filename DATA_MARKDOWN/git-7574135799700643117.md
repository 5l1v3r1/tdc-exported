The Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan has announced a new 17-track, double album titled Cotillions which is out November 22 on his own Martha’s Music label. Like on 2017’s Ogilala, he’s releasing under his full name, William Patrick Corgan. He announced the album on his socials, saying fans should hear it for themselves “before others tell you what my songs are or aren’t”:
Billy went on to say that a new Smashing Pumpkins album “will be out soon enough.” The band’s last album, Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun., was released last year, and saw the return of original drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and guitarist James Iha.
