Xiaomi and Samsung have been teasing a new 108MP camera module for quite some time now and shared that they're working together to bring the first 100MP+ phone to the market. This device has now been introduced as the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro. Other than the 108MP sensor, it sports four more lenses on its back, making it look almost as ridiculous as the Nokia 9 PureView. The phone is coming to international markets as the Mi Note 10.
