ABC 7 News’s Kevin Lewis reports that Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) has “quietly reversed” the county’s sanctuary policy whereby agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had been banned from entering secure locations of the county jail to properly take custody over illegal aliens charged with crimes.
Now, Montgomery County officials will allow ICE agents to place a detainer on criminal illegal aliens in their custody and schedule a date and time to pick up those suspects from certain areas of the county jail. Still, ICE agents remain banned from entering county-owned facilities such as libraries and police stations.
The partial dropping of the county’s sanctuary policy comes after at least nine illegal aliens had been charged with sex crimes and rape — often against children — in the region over the course of just two months.
