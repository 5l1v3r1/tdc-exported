Since topping at $10,500 last week, Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a relative state of calm, trading within a tight range between $9,000 and $9,500. As of the time of writing this article, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands for $9,250, trading 1% up on the day.
According to this a number of analysts, this bullish consolidation, which comes as some have been calling for BTC to return under $9,000, is a sign that a short-term rally is inbound. A rally that could bring Bitcoin close to $10,000 once again.
Analyst MacN recently argued that Bitcoin’s “very messy cluster” price action is currently forming into a “textbook pump setup,” with the market starting to trend higher in a tight channel. He added that with the cryptocurrency failing to “break down for so long,” he is inclined to suggest that a move to the $9,550s — some 3% higher than the current price — “is getting very likely.”
He added that by tomorrow, Saturday, the range/channel will be tight enough for Bitcoin to bounce higher in the direction of his target.
