Reflecting on how fast the year has passed is definitely a sign of getting old but in less than two months 2019 will be over, the last fireworks at your New Year's celebrations will have gone off, and hopefully you got the New Years kiss you wanted. It’s hard to sum up a year in a few words, never mind one term. However, that’s what the Collins Dictionary does every year and you’ll hardly be surprised by this year's winner. 'Climate Strike' is the official word (or phrase, really) of 2019 according to Collins Dictionary and, when it comes to influential individuals, the teen that inspired this phrase has to be one of the biggest world changers of 2019.
Collins Dictionary defined Climate Strike as:
It’s the form of protest that got the world's attention after climate change activist Greta Thunberg encouraged students and people to take to the streets to raise awareness for the climate change crisis. Throughout 2019, millions of school children followed Thunberg's lead and marched against the lack of action being taken. In September 2019, an estimated seven million people joined the worldwide climate strike, also known as the Global Week for Future.
Speaking to the Independent about this year's winning word, language content consultant at Collins Helen Newstead said, “‘Climate strikes’ can often divide opinion, but they have been inescapable this last year and have even driven a former word of the year.”
