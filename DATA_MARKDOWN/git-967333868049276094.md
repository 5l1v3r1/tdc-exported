        Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of prostituting underage girls, was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell at the age of 66. His death was ostensibly the result of a suicide by hanging, although a reputable pathologist has just announced that he believes Epstein was strangled to death.
      
Hillary Clinton laughed when fielding a satirical question about how she managed to kill Jeffrey Epstein.
During Clinton’s appearance on the Daily Show on Thursday together with daughter Chelsea, host Trevor Noah asked: “I have to ask you a question that has been plaguing me for a while, how did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?”
Hillary and Chelsea burst out laughing, before Noah continued: “You seem to be behind everything nefarious, and yet you do not use it to become president. What is the game plan? What does it feel like being the boogeyman of the right?”
Noah clearly asked the question in jest, parodying the many conspiracy theories – including the famous ‘Clinton Body Count’ suggesting that Bill and Hillary Clinton secretly assassinate their political enemies.
“It’s a constant surprise to me because the things they say, and, now, of course it’s on steroids with being online, are so ridiculous beyond any imagination that I could have and yet, they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ideas and theories,” Clinton said.
