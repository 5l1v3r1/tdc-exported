Â 
"We have been carrying out enquiries however we're now appealing for the public's help to trace him.
"Similarly if Darren reads our appeal, please contact us or your family to let people know you are okay."
If anyone has seen Darren, his car or has any information about his disappearance, please call 101 quoting incident number 3399 of 3 November 2019.
