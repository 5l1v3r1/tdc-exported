A West Lothian counselling service for young people were delighted to receive a fresh funding boost from a local business.
SMILE counselling service received a pledge of £12,000 from Workflo Solutions who are based in Livingston.
The charity was created in 2015 and has been helping lots of young people in West Lothian but were close to capacity because of funding issues so this will mean more young people can use their free service.
 
Declan Harrigan, founder and clinical director of SMILE, said: “I have to say that I am still overwhelmed with Michael’s extremely generous donation to SMILE I can’t reflect enough the amazing impact this will have on our children and young people.”
