Details of Disney+ were announced back in April, a move that’s been anticipated for a number of years, and came after Disney completed a $71.3 billion acquisition of a number of 21st Century Fox’s key assets, including its film and TV studios and a large amount of its ‘content portfolio’.
As per a new promotional video shared today on Twitter, viewers will be eventually able to stream Disney-owned and distributed content including Star Wars films, Marvel films and Disney animatied classics.
