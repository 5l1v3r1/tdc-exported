Grace Jones has accepted an invite to curate next year’s Meltdown festival, saying “it’s about time”.
The singer, 71, known for her androgynous look and distinctive wardrobe, will oversee and headline the Southbank Centre event.
Jones, who has previously performed at Meltdown,  said she was “honoured” to turn her hand to curating.
She added: “Year after year, the festival continues to spread its colourful wings, allowing its curators to bring together an array of diverse talent not seen anywhere else.
