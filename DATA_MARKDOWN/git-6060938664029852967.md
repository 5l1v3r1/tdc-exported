NEW DELHI: India cricket captain Virat Kohli celebrated his 31st birthday on Tuesday with his wife and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma.
Kohli and Anushka are reportedly in Bhutan, as Kohli takes a well deserved break from cricket.
Kohli took to Twitter and shared a photo with Anushka and wrote: “What a blessing to be able to visit such divine places with my soulmate. Also thank you everyone for your kind wishes from the bottom of my heart.”
