A pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmaker out campaigning on Wednesday was stabbed by an anti-government protester, marking the latest escalation of violence surrounding the demonstrations that began over the summer demanding political reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
Junius Ho, who is despised by protesters because of his alleged links to violent attacks on demonstrators, was out on the street campaigning for local elections when he was approached by another man on Wednesday.

In a video obtained by the South China Morning Post, the man gives flowers to Ho and asks permission to take a photo with him. He then can be heard saying, "Let me take out my mobile phone, OK?"
The man then draws a knife from his bag, stabbing Ho in the chest before he is quickly overpowered by the lawmaker and others.
