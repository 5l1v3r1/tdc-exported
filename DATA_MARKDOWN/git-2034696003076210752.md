        "A sound or a colour evoke a feeling or a memory and you chase that down a rabbit hole and see what it unravels from your subconscious."
      
Twin Atlantic have shared the new video for ‘Novocaine’ – the first track to emerge from their upcoming fourth album, ‘Power’. Check exclusive behind the scenes photos on NME.com.
Described by NME as a “futuristic, synth-rock anthem“, Novocaine is accompanied by a video that shows off the full force of the Twin Atlantic live experience.
“The collage approach to Alex’s idea was really appealing to us. It’s the exact same way we have been approaching writing lyrics on this album,” said frontman Sam McTrusty.
