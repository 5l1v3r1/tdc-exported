It’s been a long time since the Jets and Dolphins played a meaningful game, and Sunday’s contest sure wasn’t that.
The only storylines in play were the Dolphins trying to get their first win of the season, and Jets head coach Adam Gase attempting to get revenge on the team he was with this time last year.
And while this divisional rivalry used to feature fans from both teams packing the stands in South Florida — given how many New York transplants live in the Sunshine State — Sunday’s game at Hard Rock stadium was virtually empty. Have a look for yourself.
