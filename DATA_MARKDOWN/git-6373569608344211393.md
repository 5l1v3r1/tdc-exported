Westlife are coming back to Plymouth - but who remembers when they played at Home Park in 2008?
The exciting news was announced this morning that Westlife will be performing at Plymouth's Home Park stadium on July 4 2020.
The band will also perform all of their greatest hits including Swear It Again, Flying Without Wings and You Raise Me Up.
But who remembers their gig 11 years ago in Plymouth?
Westlife performed at Home Park on Saturday, June 28 2008. It is estimated that over 18,000 fans went to watch them perform.
At the time Westlife had already been going for 10 years and the one year break they were on caused their concerts to sell more tickets than ever.
It wasn't just Westlife that performed - Simon Webbe, previously of Blue with backing singers and a band also took to the stage.
And lifelong Westlife fan Paula Chapman was Flying Without Wings when she finally got to meet her musical heroes. Paula went to a meet and greet with the boy band at Home Park just before their long-awaited concert. She said the Irish lads were 'amazing' during the gig â€“ and she said it was a 'dream come true' to meet them. She got to meet the lads thanks to help from The Herald and Plymouth Argyle.
