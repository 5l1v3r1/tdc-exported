Tourists and locals will now have to pay $7 (Rs.500) as a cleanliness tax for taking pictures in Parra Village in India’s coastal state of Goa.
The “Cleanliness tax” or “photography tax” would be applied if people shoot video or take a photograph on the road of the village in this tourist destination. 
However, the imposition of a new tax has faced severe opposition from locals who fear that the move might discourage tourists form visiting the iconic location.
The move by the local authorities of the village became moot after a video of tourists being charged in Parra Village went viral on social media. The video was recorded by Paul Fernandes, a local resident.
