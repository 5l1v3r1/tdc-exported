Singer Sona Mohapatra has launched a stunning attack against cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar as she took her #MeToo allegations globally. Attacking Tendulkar for endorsing the singing reality show whose judges include Anu Malik, Neha Kakkar and Vishal Dadlani, Sona expressed her displeasure that Sony TV had decided to rope in someone accused of sexual misconduct as one of its judges.
She wrote, “..Powerful conglomerate like Sony TV is trying to divert their shameful reinstating of a multiple accused sexual offender, Anu Malik, as a judge on Indian Idol by publicising a sporting hero & India’s icon, Sachin Tendulkar’s praise on Twitter for somecontestants, (a marketing exercise) & riding on his hard-earned goodwill. Diabolical? Yes.”
Earlier addressing Tendulkar on Twitter, Sona had asked, “Dear Sachin, Are you aware of all the@IndiaMeToo stories of multiple women, some minors who came forward in the public domain about Anu Malik, the judge in this same Indian Idol show last year including their own ex-producer? Does their trauma not matter or touch anyone?”
