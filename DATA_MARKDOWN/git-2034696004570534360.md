Billie Eilish will be releasing a new song next week.
In an Instagram story today (November 6), the pop star told her fans that a new Vanity Fair piece about her wouldn’t be out for a few weeks, but as a “compromise” she’d be releasing a new song next week. See screengrabs of her story below.
This comes shortly after Eilish announced, also on Instagram stories, that she’d be dropping new music and a video for ‘Xanny’, from her debut album, ‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’. In that earlier post, she stopped short of announcing a release date or window.
In the dimly lit video, Eilish speaks to the camera: “Yes, the ‘Xanny’ video is coming. Yes, I have two unreleased songs that are coming that you haven’t heard any of.” After a pause, she remarks, “Be patient, damn!”
