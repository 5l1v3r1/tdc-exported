A FORMER convent site in Mayo is to be revitalised.
Mayo County Council has unveiled plans for a library and civic offices in the grounds of a former convent in Westport.
Government funding has been in place for the project for over four years.
A public consultation process is underway and will remain open until December 10.
Local Councillor Peter Flynn said the site is a very historic one and central to the town's heritage.
He welcomed the plans, adding they may involve a public/private partnership to bring the project to fruition.
A number of local people have called for a memorial to be erected on a part of the site where an orphanage and industrial school once existed.
