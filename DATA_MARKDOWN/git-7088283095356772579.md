        The Ghislaine Dupont-Claude Verlon award, launched six years ago in commemoration of the two RFI journalists murdered in Mali, has been awarded to Myriam Iragi Maroy and Vital Mugisho in an emotional ceremony in Kinshasa, DRC.
      
The journalist and technician received the award on Saturday 2 November, exactly six years after Dupont and Verlon were assassinated in Kidal, Mali, while they were reporting on elections.
Myriam Iragi Maroy, 33, is a journalist at Radio Top Congo in Kinshasa. She was selected for the clarity of her writing and the quality of witness accounts she gathered in her report Les filles-mères en RDC (young mothers in DRC).
