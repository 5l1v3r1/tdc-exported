The new, upcoming series of the Pokémon anime is sounding like it could be one of the most intriguing - and unique - takes on the show so far. We've already heard that it's set to take place across all regions from Kanto to Galar, and with how the Sun and Moon story arc ended, the plot may well take a very different turn, too.
Now, we've got our hands on the very first trailer for the upcoming season. It stars Ash and new companion Go, as well as a number of familiar Pokémon, and we even get to hear a section of what we assume will be the new theme song in Japan. Give it a watch below.
