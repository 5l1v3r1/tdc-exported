Lauder spoke at the Second World Jewish Congress International Meeting of Special Envoys and Coordinators for Combating Antisemitism, a meeting of three dozen officials from around the globe.
“After three decades, antisemitism has now reared its head,” said Lauder. “Antisemitism, even after 1945, was here. It was quiet, underground, but it was here. It didn’t disappear.”
Citing the Yom Kippur synagogue attack in the German city of Halle, in which an antisemitic gunman attempted to attack the congregation barricaded inside, and then proceeded to kill two passersby when he could not enter the building, Lauder asked of the killer, “Where’d he get the information?”
“It didn’t come from the air,” he stated. “It came over the internet. He was someone who frankly sat at home and looked at the internet and got angry.”
At the moment, he noted, “There’s no ability to stop this stuff coming. We can find out where every piece on the internet comes from if we want to. No one’s doing it.”
