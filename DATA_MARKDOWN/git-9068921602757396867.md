At its annual MAX conference today, Adobe announced a range of new features for its Creative Cloud suite of software for Macs and PCs, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign, and more.
Adobe Lightroom Adobe is releasing a major update to Photoshop on the desktop today with several improvements based on its Sensei artificial intelligence technology, including new capabilities in the Object Selection Tool and Content-Aware-Fill. Adobe has added three ways to identify where in your image you want Content-Aware Fill to look for source pixels as fill content:
The latest version of Photoshop is faster for many tasks, including opening files on a Mac. Adobe has added new quick action buttons to accelerate common tasks, such as the ability to one-click to remove a background, select a subject while in the pixel layer properties panel, or quickly convert text layers into a frame or shape. Preset workflows have been overhauled, with new, dedicated panels and behaviors for gradients, patterns, and shapes. Presets can be organized into groups, and you can drag and move to rearrange and re-order them.
