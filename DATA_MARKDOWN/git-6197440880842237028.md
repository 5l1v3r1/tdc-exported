The cameras on our smartphones are just getting better and better, and now Adobe is hoping to help everyone take better shots. Today, the company has announced its new Photoshop Camera app for Android and iOS which can use AI to edit as you take the picture.
Coming in 2020, the Photoshop Camera app uses the company’s Sensei AI to recognize subjects and apply filters and edits in real-time. There are plenty of apps to apply filters to a photo on Android and iOS, but Photoshop Camera takes a different approach.
This app applies more “Photoshop Magic” to a picture by making dramatic edits that can even replace the background of an image on the fly. The app is launching widely in 2020, but some users will be able to use it early by signing up on Adobe’s website.
