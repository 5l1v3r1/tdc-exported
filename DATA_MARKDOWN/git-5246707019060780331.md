To celebrate the launch of Luigi's Mansion 3 on Switch, UK retailer Zavvi has produced some limited-edition items which tie-in with the game â€“ including a glow-in-the-dark print and a rather fetching varsity jacket.
The jacket is only available for 7 days, so if you like the look of it, you'd better act fast. Oh, and while you're here, don't forget that by entering the code NINTENDOLIFE25 you can get 25% off the total order.
