Police in the Czech Republic have launched an investigation into complaints that a mask depicting Adolf Hitler was spotted on sale in a shop in Prague.
Christoph Israng, the German ambassador to the Czech Republic, tweeted a picture of the mask the day after Halloween as he passed the shop.
"The Czechs suffered so much under the Nazis," he wrote, adding: "Why is such trash sold in the middle of Prague?"
