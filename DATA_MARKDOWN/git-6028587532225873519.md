Topline: Drake’s More Life Growth Company joins the ranks of celebrity-driven cannabis partnerships with Canopy Growth, which has been in a protracted slump.
Crucial quote: “The idea of being able to build something special in an industry that is ever growing has been inspiring. More Life and More Blessing,” said Drake in a press release.
Key background: The who’s who of celebrities working with Canopy include Snoop Dogg and his best friend Martha Stewart, along with actor Seth Rogan. Rapper Jay-Z, actress Whoopi Goldberg and singer Melissa Etheridge also have cannabis ventures with other companies. Despite its famous partners, Canopy reported a C$1.3 billion loss in the quarter ending June 30. Both U.S.- and Canada-based marijuana companies are struggling in 2019, with share prices tumbling and mergers scrapped.
Tangent: More Life will be based in Toronto, Drake’s hometown.
