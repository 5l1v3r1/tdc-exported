        The Democrat-led House of Representatives voted in favour of a resolution to set down ground rules for the impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Thursday. The resolution included a mandate for public hearings, the release of transcripts on previous closed-door hearings, as well as rules for the president and his council in mounting a defence.
      
Televangelist and presidential spiritual advisor Paula White and over two dozen other pastors and faith leaders were asked to lay their hands on the president and pray for him at a meeting in the White House last week, Christian news magazine Charisma News has reported.
White, who delivered the invocation at Trump’s inauguration, is the chair of the administration’s evangelical advisory board, and has known the businessman since 2002, when he contacted her after watching her on television.
According to Charisma News, the meeting discussed Trump’s “accomplishments on behalf of evangelical Christians, including defending religious freedom, battling opioid addiction, reducing abortion and nominating conservative and pro-life Supreme Court judges.”
White posted a photo of the pastors’ visit with Trump in the White House.
Pastor Jack Graham of the Prestonwood Baptist Church in Texas, tweeted about the impeachment hearings last week, calling the probe a “manipulative and bogus ‘investigation’” which was “bad for our country and should be stopped.” His sentiment was echoed by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council Protestant activist group, following the meeting with Trump.
