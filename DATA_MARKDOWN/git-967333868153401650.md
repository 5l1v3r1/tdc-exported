        New Delhi (Sputnik): China and Pakistan have signed a slew of projects under the multi-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), including the Gwadar Master Plan. Pakistan has sought $9 billion from China to finance the Main Railway Line (ML-1) and other infrastructure projects in the project’s Phase 2.
      
While announcing that the 9th Joint Cooperation Committee meeting of CPEC was successful, the Chinese foreign ministry said the two “iron brothers” have approved and signed two agreements, including a Gwadar Master Plan.
The Pakistani military is in the process of raising a division headquarters of the 44th Light Infantry in Balochistan’s Gwadar to coordinate security initiatives and protect the CPEC.
New Delhi has consistently expressed concerns to both China and Pakistan on the projects, as it considers that the project violates India’s sovereignty.
The CPEC is a flagship infrastructure-related project conceived by Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of Beijing's expanded multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposing to create more efficient commercial links between the continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe.
