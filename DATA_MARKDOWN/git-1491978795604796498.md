        South Africa’s emphatic victory in the Rugby World Cup final leaves supporters flat
      
England rugby fans were left as miserable as the weather after their team’s defeat to South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final in Japan, a repeat of their heartache after the Springboks’ victory in the 2007 final.
Supporters filled pubs up and down the country for the 9am kick-off, tucking into sausage rolls and pints of Guinness. The British Beer and Pub Association had predicted that 1m extra pints would be sold throughout Saturday if England were victorious.
But in keeping with the wet and windy weather across parts of the UK, the game turned into a damp squib for Eddie Jones’s side as South Africa’s swept to victory 32-12.
Handre Pollard’s penalties and late tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe made the difference, leaving England’s dreams of lifting the trophy in shreds.
Both the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, paid tribute to the England side on Twitter.
