Security guards had to remove a mainland student after he waved a knife at students staging a protest at their graduation ceremony, which was ultimately cut short this morning.
Videos and photos circulating online show the student — wearing a brightly patterned shirt — waving the knife and singing the Chinese national anthem at graduating students at the university mall, a well-known walkway at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
