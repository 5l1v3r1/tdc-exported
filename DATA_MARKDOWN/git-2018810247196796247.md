Howdy, partner.
If you've been waiting for Rockstar's Wild West to finally come to PC, then this week is for you. It's launching through the Epic Games Store, Rockstar's own launcher, Humble Bundle and Green Man Gaming this week, but if you really want the game through Steam then you'll have to wait another month.
And, of course, there's Hideo Kojima.
If you just have to see what Death Stranding is all about, you'll finally be able to from this week. There's a ton of footage that can't be released until after the game's launch too â€” the discussion later this week should be plenty fun.
There's a few standouts on the PC too. Planet Zoo drops later this week, and there's a new Need for Speed. The Switch gets a Professor Layton title and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, if you're into Tokyo 2020 themed mini-games.
There's definitely plenty to choose from. Here's the full roster:
Onto the trailers. You know which one we're starting with, of course.
Need for Speed.
Just kidding.
It's Garfield Kart.
