St. Anthony, who is the Patron Saint of what is lost or stolen, had prayers answered when this charity box was stolen from a fast food outlet in Dundalk recently.
Following investigations by Garda√≠ - and a few prayers - one man was arrested and the charity box was located with all contents recovered.
