ARCADIA, Calif.: Bricks and Mortar edged United by a head to win the US$4 million Breeders' Cup Turf on Saturday, finishing his season undefeated and making a strong case for Horse of the Year honors.
After being stuck in traffic in the early going the even-money favorite surged from the outside to overtake United down the stretch and claim his sixth win in six starts this season.
The win was jockey Irad Ortiz and trainer Chad Brown's third at the Breeders' Cup this weekend.
Longshot United (50-1) had to settle for second and Anthony Van Dyck was third in the 1-1/2 mile race on turf.
