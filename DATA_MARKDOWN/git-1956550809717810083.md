There’s a brand-new café open in Dubai’s Galleria Mall – and a chef from famed London restaurant Chiltern Firehouse is at the helm.TBK is from the team behind The Boutique Kitchen and Asma and is being billed as a “casual neigh-bourhood eatery in the setting of an upscale bistro”.The low-key spot in Galleria Mall is promising a relaxed setting to enjoy a bite to eat, and if it’s anything like the other restaurants under the brand’s umbrella we’re expecting top things.TBK will offer all-day dining from an Italian American-inspired menu. Dishes on the new menu include pulled beef sandwiches, sloppy joes and gourmet pastas such as prawn orzo. There will also be breakfasts including egg dishes, avocado on toast and pancakes.And if you’re a fan of the fried chicken at The Boutique Kitchen then you’re in luck as the same popular recipe is on the menu at TBK.Chef Adriano Molli is heading up the kitchen team, so if you’ve been to the popular Marylebone restaurant Chiltern Firehouse you’re going to want to check this spot out too.Open daily 8am-11pm. Galleria Mall, Jumeirah (04 340 0222).
