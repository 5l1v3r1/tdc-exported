FREETOWN, Mass. - A rollover crash in Freetown, Mass. killed a 34-year-old Wareham man and sent two other people to the hospital, according to an official release from the Massachusetts State Police. The crash occurred around 5 p.m. on Sunday evening on Route 24 South around mile 12.4 on the highway. 
The two victims sent to nearby hospitals are a 34-year-old Taunton woman, who sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old female, who police say had, "no visible injuries." 
The fatal victim was declared deceased at the scene due to injuries sustained during the crash. His identity has not been released, pending notification of family. 
The investigation is still ongoing, police say. Preliminary details show that the 2003 Ford Escape that the trio were traveling in veered off the right side of the highway and rolled over, ejecting the two adults.
The right travel lane was closed while police were reconstructing the crash.
