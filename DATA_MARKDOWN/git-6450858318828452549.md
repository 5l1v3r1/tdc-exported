Ever since initial launch as Championship Manager in 1992, the Football Manager games have been the definitive simulator for those looking to take charge of their favourite team. 
Combined with FIFA, it has provided a comprehensive video game experience for fans of the beautiful game. However, FM has always been considered more in-depth, offering granular control over nearly every aspect of how a club is run.
FM 2020 looks set to continue that trend, and will be released on 19 November. A fully playable beta is available now, having been released a full five days ahead of schedule.
