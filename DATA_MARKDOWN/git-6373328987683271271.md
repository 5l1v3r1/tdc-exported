        Google have announced that they’ve bought wearable smart device company Fitbit for a massive $2.1 billion.
      
The SVP of devices and services at Google, Rick Osterloh, said that the Fitbit purchase was “an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market.”
The news was no surprise after reports of a potential purchase had been circulating for a few days.
Google is one of the last tech companies to have moved into the smart watch market, falling way behind the likes of Apple and Samsung.
The purchase of Fitbit could be an opportunity for the California-based company to compete with the Apple Watch.
Fitbit was founded in 2007 by James Park and Eric Friedman, building products to help track your activity, exercise, food, weight and sleep.
After the purchase was agreed, Fitbit confirmed in a statement that it won’t sell personal information and that their health and wellness data will not be used in Google adverts.
