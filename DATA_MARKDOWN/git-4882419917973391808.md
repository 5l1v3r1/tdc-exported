Ernesto Valverde has opted to make changes to his side for Barcelona's league game at Levante following the 5-1 win over Real Valladolid in midweek.
The Barcelona coach has brought Sergi Roberto, Arthur Melo and Antoine Griezmann into the side as the Catalans look to strengthen their grip on top spot.
Sergi Roberto comes in at right-back, with Nelson Semedo swapping to left-back and Jordi Alba, who picked up a knock in midweek, only on the bench. Junior Firpo is not even in the squad.
Arthur, meanwhile, replaced Sergio Busquets in the side. He plays in a midfield three alongside Frenkie de Jong and Arturo Vidal, who starts for the second game running.
Finally, Griezmann is back in the starting lineup alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Ansu Fati drops to the bench, where he's joined by Carles Perez.
Full Bar√ßa team: Ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Semedo, De Jong, Arthur, Vidal, Messi, Suarez, Griezmann.
