        The Trump campaign has lashed out at Twitter’s decision to ban political advertisements, calling it “very dumb”. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday that his company will introduce the ban on 22 November.
      
In a series of tweets announcing the move, Dorsey said that “political message reach should be earned, not bought” by politicians.
