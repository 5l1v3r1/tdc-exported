A 9-year-old Texas boy has been cleared to go home Friday after undergoing multiple surgeries following a dog attack, according to reports.
This week Austyn Clanton of Beaumont told a reporter what was happening in the moments leading up to the mauling.
“Me and my big brother were fighting,” Austyn told Houston’s KPRC-TV. “The American bulldog jumped on me. He started biting and scratching.”

According to Austyn, the dog, named Mattis, was trying to protect his older brother, Trystan.
"Mattis was trying to protect Trystan and Mattis attacked me," he told Houston's FOX 26. "I got in the house but he still wouldn't get off."
