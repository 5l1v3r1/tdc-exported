        The news comes after the US placed Huawei, ZTE and over 70 other Chinese telecom on an entities list in May, citing allegations that Huawei posed a 'national security threat' to US infrastructure and barring the Chinese multinationals from buying and selling to US firms.
      
Huawei can lead without help from the United States and could produce its own products and technologies, company founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
The tech giant would not be used as a "bargaining chip" in trade talks, Ren said, adding that the Chinese telecoms giant could "survive without the US" and would embrace globalisation instead.
Ren Zhengfei added that he would welcome US firms to sells parts and components to Huawei, but that the company would survive if they chose not to.
There were no difficulties under the Obama and Trump administrations, he said, adding that US president Donald Trump gave the Chinese firm the impetus to "survive by ourselves and work harder".
