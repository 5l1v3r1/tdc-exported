A video of the incident showed that the man stepped the wrong way on the yellow safety strip as the subway car approached.
KPIX reported that the incident took place at 5:20 p.m. on Sunday at the BART Coliseum station when BART Transportation Supervisor John O’Connor was working that evening to help with crowd control after the Oakland Raiders game.
As the train zoomed by, O’Connor grabbed the man using his shoulders and yanked him back up onto the platform, according to the video.
A video posted to Twitter showed the two men giving each other a hug moments after the harrowing incident.
