The anonymous forum 8Chan – a haven for far-right extremists, conspiracy theorists, and internet filth – came back online today after going dark in August due to its association with several mass shootings. Rebranded as 8kun (“kun” and “chan” are both honorific titles in Japanese for you non-weebs out there), the forum now has an important caveat to the no-holds-barred approach to free speech it previously touted, and it’s outlined in plain language on the site’s front page: Anything considered illegal in the United States will be removed.
Exactly how many of 8Chan’s millions of former users visited its new iteration today is unclear, but site administrator Ron Watkins, son of 8Chan’s owner and operator Jim Watkins, said in a Youtube video that heavy traffic and cyberattacks were causing significant problems on the site. According to 8Chan’s Twitter, most of the top 25 subforums on 8Chan have been migrated over and they’ve received more than 200 board migration requests.
