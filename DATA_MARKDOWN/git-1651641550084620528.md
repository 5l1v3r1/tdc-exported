According to a report by Digitimes, Apple is partnering with Valve, an American video game developer, publisher, and digital distribution company, to develop its AR headset. The report also claims that the headset will be launched next year.
The two companies worked together back in 2017 to add native VR headset support to macOS High Sierra. This time around, however,  the focus area is AR, not VR.
Apple’s upcoming AR headset has been in the news for long, but they’re all rumors until the release of the iOS 13 final build, along with which came a read me file that mentioned steps for developers on how to test AR apps without the AR headset.
According to Bloomberg, Apple’s AR headset will be powered by a new OS dubbed “rOS,” which will, of course, be developed by Apple. While we still don’t know the name of Apple’s AR headset, the device is expected to hit the market in the second half of 2020.
