Kojima Productions has just released its first game, Death Stranding, since it was resurrected in 2015, but it's already looking to expand into movies. In a BBC documentary about Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima was confident about the developer's ability to pivot to a different medium. 
"In the future, Kojima Productions will start making films," Kojima said. "If you can do one thing well, then you can do everything well."
While that's demonstrably untrue, Kojima Productions is perhaps better poised to create movies. The studio's style is cinematic, while Death Stranding leans on lots of well known actors, while Kojima himself loves to make nearly feature-length cutscenes and has something of an obsession with cinema.
