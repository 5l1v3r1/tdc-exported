Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the increase in the rejection of H1-B Visas for Indians in the US. This was after a US think-tank said that Donald Trump’s restrictive policies on immigration have led to the denials of applications for H1-B Visas by Indians.
Taking to Twitter, Priyanka wrote in Hindi, “Everyone should ask the BJP government as to who’s being helped under its regime. Prime Minister travelled to America for his own ‘Howdy, Modi’ but America increased the number of rejections the H1-B Visas for Indians, willing to work there.”
