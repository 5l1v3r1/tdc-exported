MUMBAI: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, the billionaire investor known for his nifty stock-picking skills, on Monday bought nearly 1.3 crore shares of troubled lender Yes Bank, or about 0.5% of its equity, at Rs 67 apiece for Rs 87 crore in total. The small stake buy by the ace stock player in Yes Bank came days after the lender said that its board was considering a proposal by an investor to infuse $1.2 billion (about Rs 8,500 crore) through the equity route.
In a subsequent analysts’ meet, the bank’s management said it had proposals worth about $3 billion in total for infusing in the bank’s equity from various investors.
Jhunjhunwala also holds a 2.5% stake in troubled lender DHFL, the company’s September shareholding showed.
Over the last twenty years, some of his most famous bets were Titan and Crisil. In both of the companies his investments went up by more than 100 times over a few years and he still holds stakes in these companies.
He holds stakes in several other companies including Edelweiss Financial Services, Lupin and Multi Commodity Exchange.
