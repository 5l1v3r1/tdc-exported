        WASHINGTON (Sputnik) – The US state of California asked a court to intervene in an investigation of Facebook’s business practices and user privacy violations by ordering the social media giant to comply with an earlier subpoena, Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a press release on Wednesday.
      
The state issued investigative subpoenas against Facebook starting back in June 2018 to examine the company’s actions and business practices and any violations of user privacy, the release said.
California is seeking Facebook documents related to Cambridge Analytica, a UK political data firm that acquired access to personal data of more than 80 million Americans and reportedly used the data to influence the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit vote.
