"The View" co-host Meghan McCain continued to bring the fire Friday in a social media feud with Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign, suggesting the New Jersey Democrat's staff should focus less on tweeting since he's "polling in 11th."
The feud began on Wednesday when Booker appeared on the daytime talk show and had a fiery exchange with McCain over his previous support for mandatory buybacks on guns, which she referred to as a "left-wing fever dream."
The discussion got tenser after Booker refused to directly answer McCain's question as to how he would implement mandatory buybacks.
"With all due respect, the gun buybacks. The gun buybacks," McCain said as Booker recalled a story about a voter wanting to punch President Trump in the face. "Just tell me semantically how you're going to get my brother's [AR-15] back."
"Look, machine guns we don't have on the streets anymore, right? Because, in the 1980s, we banned them, and we had a practical way to do that," Booker said. "From Australia to New Zealand, they banned them and they got them off the streets."
