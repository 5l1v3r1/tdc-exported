Olivia Newton-John’s iconic “Grease” leather pants have found a new owner.
Spanx founder Sara Blakely snapped up the costume, which Newton-John wore when she played the role of Sandy in the 1978 film, at an auction the actress participated in to support her Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre. Blakely paid $162,000 for the leather pants.
“I have been the biggest fan of Olivia since I was a little girl, since ‘Grease’ came out,” Blakely said in an interview on “CBS This Morning” on Tuesday. “My friend called me two days before the auction. I didn’t know it was happening and she said, ‘Sara, they’re putting the pants up, the outfit for charity,’ and I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’ve got to try to get these.’”
