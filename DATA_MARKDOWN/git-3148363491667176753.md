KNCA reported that North Korea’s Academy of Defence Science “succeeded in another test-fire of super-large multiple rocket launchers” as part of an effort to “verify the security of launchers’ continuous fire system.”
“The successful test-fire result was directly reported to the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on the spot,” the agency reported.
State newspaper Rodong Sinmun published of the multiple rocket launcher, surrounded by yellow flames and smoke. The test reportedly left communist dictator Kim Jong-un feeling satisfied.
