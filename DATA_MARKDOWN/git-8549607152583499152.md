        During his most recent appearance on Kitco, Max Keiser suggested that if the Chinese national cryptocurrency should be backed by gold, then this would be a massive blow against the USD and very bullish for Bitcoin. The well-known gold supporter Peter Schiff on the contrary claims that if this were to happen, Bitcoin would be in real danger. 
      
A lot of the details regarding China’s cryptocurrency have not been divulged yet, but according to well-known Bitcoin investor Max Keiser, the cryptocurrency that China’s rolling out will be backed by gold. His deduction comes mainly from the fact that China has added more than 100 tons of gold to its reserves since it resumed buying in December 2018, a rather strange event considering that every economy is based on fiat currencies.

Keiser added that this scenario is terribly dangerous for the U.S. dollar and could undermine its supremacy as the reference currency. Things are inverse for Bitcoin instead because, according to Keiser, Bitcoin would represent a superior form of currency to gold and the dollar.
The CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff responded to comments made by the bitcoin bull by saying that if China is about to launch a cryptocurrency backed by gold, this would be bullish for gold and bearish for Bitcoin.
