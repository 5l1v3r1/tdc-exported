THE CLAIM A video of a Hindu family in Pakistan being robbed has been shared on social media. It was also shared by a Twitter user, who later deleted it. SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH? After a reverse search on Google, it was found that the video was shot in Karachi. The video was posted on a YouTube channel named after the news outlet 'Dawn'. The video was titled, ‘Karachi mein 4 kam umar dakuon ki loot mar’ (‘4 underage robbers in Karachi’)
