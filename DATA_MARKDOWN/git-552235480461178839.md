Have a look at the newest establishment in East Kilbride, The Coppertree.
Having opened this week the trendy new night spot, which is near Hairmyres, will be serving locally sourced produce, from steak to cocktails.
Have a look through some photos of the new nightspot, provided to us by Claremont Furniture.
Owner Mark Craig, who lives in Stewartfield, spoke to the EK News about this exciting new adventure.
He said: "Everything is sourced from EK, nothing is frozen. We have a farm in Jackton and a new distillery there as well.
"We dry age our own beef and when it touches your tongue, it is like butter."
Mark and his team have been involved in this industry for over 35 years, so know exactly what they are doing.
"We want to create a new experience here. We wnat people to come in for a few drinks, have a beautiful meal and then sit until the wee hours listening to live music and having drinks.
"We saw a gap in the market in East Kilbride and jumped on it. I am really excited to get going."
