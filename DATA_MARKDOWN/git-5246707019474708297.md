We're fast approaching Black Friday 2019 - which technically takes place on 29th November - and Nintendo has let us in on its very best offers on Nintendo Switch consoles, games, and accessories.
The highlight of the bunch is a Nintendo Switch console bundle which throws in a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at no extra charge. Starting on 28th November, you'll be able to get the bundle for $299.99 - the regular price of a standalone Switch console.
That's not all, though, as a selection of major Nintendo releases will have $20 knocked off their recommended retail price, and you'll even be able to save on accessories like Joy-Con and the Pok√© Ball Plus.
Here are all the offers, prices, and dates you need:
We'll be making sure to keep an eye on Nintendo's activities over Black Friday to share any of these great offers with you as and when they appear in stores, so make sure to check back with us nearer the time.

        Hoping to pick up a Nintendo bargain this Black Friday? Let us know in the comments.
