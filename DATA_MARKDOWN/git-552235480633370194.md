Celtic could be handed a boost ahead of their Europa League clash with Lazio after Ciro Immobile picked up an injury.
The striker scored as Lazio defeated AC Milan in Serie A but was then replaced in the latter stages.
And reports in Italy suggest he could miss out on Thursday night's game in Rome to ensure he is fit for league action next weekend.
It's unlikely that the injury is anything serious but Simone Inzaghi could take precautionary measures by leaving him out of the Europa League clash.
He told Rai Sport: "He had a small problem with his calf and I know how committed he is. I saw he was unsure when hitting a shot and I couldn't keep him on the pitch even if, being committed, he didn't want to come off."
Immobile grabbed his 100th goal for Lazio in the win over AC Milan with Joaquin Correa scoring the winner late on after Bastos had scored an own goal.
Celtic travel to Rome for the second of their games against Lazio after a 2-1 win in Glasgow.
Manuel Lazzari had opened the scoring for the Italian side before Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien handed Neil Lennon's men all three points.
