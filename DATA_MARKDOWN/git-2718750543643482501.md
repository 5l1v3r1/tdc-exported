If you want to boil it all the way down, the biggest story in video gaming right now is a release that features a mailman who hikes across America to reboot the internet. Death Stranding, the latest creation of legendary game designer Hideo Kojima — the mind behind Metal Gear Solid — has been shrouded in mystery throughout its development. Trailers have been baffling and cryptic. In one, a naked Norman Reedus awakens on a beach, surrounded by beached whales, and comforts a baby that he finds. In another, Mads Mikkelsen sends soldiers with skulls for faces through a war-torn hellscape as Guillermo Del Toro tries to escape through the sewers carrying a baby in a glass tank.
