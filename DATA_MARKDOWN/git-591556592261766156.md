Annoying tech-support scammers have found a new way to lock up Firefox. It's part of a scam to convince victims they need to call a bogus 'Windows support' hotline because their PC has an illegitimate license. If victims don't call within five minutes, the scammers threaten to disable the computer.
The scammers are abusing a bug in Firefox that for years allowed fraudsters to slug users with login prompt spam, presenting victims with incessant 'authentication required' prompts. The prompts act as a browser locker because they stop users from leaving or closing the browser.
