United States’ retail behemoth Walmart has decided to expand its current offerings of financial services by offering money remittance services within its network of nearly 5,000 stores across America. It already has two money transfer services (the Walmart2Walmart and Walmart2World service launched last year) but the retail giant has also decided to power Walmart2World with Ripple‘s partners MoneyGram and Ria.
