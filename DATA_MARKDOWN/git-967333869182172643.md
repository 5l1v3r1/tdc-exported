        The brothel’s employees appeared excited about the new possibilities offered by the technological innovations introduced to the establishment’s list of services, with one courtesan claiming that she’s all about “diversifying” her portfolio.
      
As the establishment’s representative Rod Thompson explained to the Daily Star, the mechanical companion was added to their roster in order to help satisfy the cravings of certain clients, "fetishes that courtesans might not be interested in."
Other new additions to the services offered by the brothel include the so called teledildonics, tech devices for remote sex, in order to allow people from other states or countries an opportunity to get intimate with their performers.
One of the cathouse’s courtesans, Stella Renee, added that she’s "very excited" about the new additions.
