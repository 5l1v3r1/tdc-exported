RIYADH: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday hailed “a new period of stability in Yemen” as a power-sharing deal was signed in Riyadh between southern separatists and Yemen’s internationally recognized government.
“This agreement will open, God willing, broader talks between Yemeni parties to reach a political solution and end the war,” the crown prince said at a televised signing ceremony.
“The kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with you. It’s a joyful day … as the two sides come together.”
