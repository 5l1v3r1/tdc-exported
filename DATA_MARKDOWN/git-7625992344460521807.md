House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a busy Thursday, leading a House vote on the next steps of the impeachment inquiry and then appearing on "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert. 
Pelosi somehow managed to find time to get from D.C. to New York City, where Colbert tapes his show. She first thanked the late-night comedian for his patriotism, then explained the vote on impeachment procedures.
"What everyone has to understand is no one is above the law. No one — not even the president of the United States," Pelosi said to a round of applause from the audience. While the conversation stayed mostly serious and political, Pelosi did crack a few jokes with Colbert.
"What we are defending is democracy," Pelosi said. "This isn't about his personality, his policies, his..." she was at a loss for words, but Colbert immediately jumped in with a silent Trump impression, mimicking the president's hand motions.
