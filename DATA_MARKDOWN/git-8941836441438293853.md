NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey Devils have acquired goaltender Louis Domingue from the Tampa Bay Lightning for a conditional seventh-round pick in the 2021 NHL draft.
The Devils announced the deal minutes before their game Friday night against the Philadelphia Flyers.
The 27-year-old Domingue was playing with Tampa Bay’s AHL team in Syracuse. He will report to the Devils’ AHL affiliate in Binghamton.
The Lightning will receive the Devils’ seventh round pick if Domingue plays in seven regular-season games for the Devils this season, or one NHL playoff game or is traded by New Jersey prior to the 2020 draft.
Domingue has a 2-1-1 record with a 3.81 goals-against average for Syracuse. He was 21-5-0 in 26 games with the Lightning, with a .908 save percentage and 2.88 goals-against average last season. In 122 career NHL games with Tampa Bay and Arizona, he is 55-49-8 record with two shutouts.
