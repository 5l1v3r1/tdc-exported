Reigning Premier League champions Manchester City are reportedly targeting a wonderkid who has been labelled the "next Kylian Mbappe", but could be forced to pay up to €88 million to get their man.

According to the latest reports in England, Pep Guardiola's side is among a number of teams chasing 21-year-old Romania international Florinel Coman.
The Daily Mail has reported that City have stepped up their chase for the Steaua Bucuresti starlet, who was once likened to Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe by the club's owner Gigi Becali.

Coman, who operates as a winger or wide forward, was part of the Romania squad that reached the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA European U21 Championship, and made his senior international debut last month.
The Citizens' pursuit of the former Viitorul Constanța star could hit a snag, however, as his contract reportedly carries an €88 million (R1.4 billion) release clause, which the club are unlikely to be willing to meet.

Coman has scored 24 goals and recorded 21 assists in 87 appearances for Steaua since joining the club back in 2017.
