Popular Kilimani joint, Space Lounge and Grill has sent all its employees packing after court compelled National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) to shut it down.
In a letter doing rounds on the interwebs, the club laid off all its staffers on Thursday
“Due to a court order issued on October 17, 2019, for revoking all our permits and liquor licences, we, therefore, wish to inform you that Space Lounge & Grill Limited will be officially closed from November 1, 2019,” the letter read in part.

The management did however assure all its workers that their salaries for the month of October will be paid by the 1st of this month.
“We have spent a lot of time together and made so many memories but now it is time to say goodbye to each other which is definitely not easy as goodbyes are the hardest…you will be missed by the heads of the company and well as it is said that goodbyes are the hardest,” the letter read on.
