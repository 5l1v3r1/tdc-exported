HMD Global's mid-range Nokia 6.2, which was introduced at IFA this year alongside the Nokia 7.2, is now on sale in the U.S. The smartphone has been priced at $249, which makes it $100 cheaper than the Nokia 7.2, which had made its way to the U.S. in September.
The Nokia 6.2 is currently available from Amazon in a single version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage. You can choose from two colors: Black and Ice Blue. While the Nokia 6.2 may not be best-in-class in every area, it still is a decent device for under $250.
The smartphone offers impressive build quality and features a large 6.3-inch PureDisplay panel with Full HD+ resolution as well as the ability to upscale video content to HDR quality in real time. It has a 14nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset under the hood, paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB of expandable storage.
In the camera department, the Nokia 6.2 has a triple camera array at the back with a 16MP primary sensor. You also get an 8MP sensor for ultra-wide shots and a 5MP sensor for depth-sensing. Some of the other key features of the Android One smartphone include an 8MP selfie camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, 3,500mAh battery, and a USB Type-C port. Being an Android One phone, the Nokia 6.2 is guaranteed to get monthly security updates for three years and OS update for two years.
The Android One Nokia 6.2 is a fantastic choice for Android purists, thanks to its stock Android Pie software and the guarantee of two major OS upgrades. It isn't shabby in the hardware department either. You get a 6.3-inch HDR display, a Snapdragon 636 processor, 64GB of expandable storage, and triple rear cameras.
