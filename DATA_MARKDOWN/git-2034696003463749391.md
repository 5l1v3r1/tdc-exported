        A good choice?
      
Harry Styles has thrown his hat into the ring to become the next James Bond.
The ‘Sign of The Times’ singer has confirmed that he’s interested in tackling the iconic role, after Daniel Craig confirmed that the upcoming No Time To Die will be his final outing as the iconic super-spy.
He told Hits Radio: “Yeah, I mean, who wouldn’t [want to be Bond]?
“I grew up watching those. You know, I loved him when I was a kid. So I think it’s kind of everyone’s dream a little bit, right?”
Styles, who made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, now joins the likes of Idris Elba, James Norton and even Peaky Blinders’ Cillian Murphy – who have all been linked with the role.
