Cape Town - Princess Diana’s niece, Lady Kitty Spencer, looks identical to Princess Charlotte in this throwback picture.
The 28-year-old took to Instagram recently to post a throwback picture of her young self riding a horse while cheekily sticking out her tongue.
"Channeling my inner jockey since 1992!" the daughter of Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, captioned her post, suggesting she was two years old when the snap was taken.

Kitty’s followers were quick to note that she resembles her four-year-old cousin, Princess Charlotte, who’s also known for her cheeky antics, The Sun reports.
"You look exactly like Charlotte," said one follower.
"Gosh you look like Princess Charlotte here," said another.
But this isn’t the first time Kitty, who’s a model, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s young daughter have been likened to each other, Elle reports.
In another throwback picture posted in 2018, avid followers pointed out her resemblance to the little princess.
