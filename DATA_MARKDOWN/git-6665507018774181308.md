“Delhi has turned into a gas chamber,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Friday as the national capital’s air quality dropped to the ‘emergency’ category. Kejriwal has been making different versions of this statement for the past three years, and yet the pollution shows no signs of abating. 
Last year, he tweeted that the Centre, Punjab and Haryana governments did nothing for the farmers. “Farmers will suffer on one hand and Delhi will become a gas chamber soon”.
