Sennheiser’s $349.95 GSP 370 Wireless Gaming Headset boasts “up to 100 hours of wireless gaming” on the back of its unassuming package. I used it for 80 hours before finally getting nervous and putting it on a charger.
Known for excellent sound delivery devices, Sennheiser isn’t a company that needs loud and flashy advertisements for its gaming gear, but the GSP 370 might be a special case. It’s so easy to miss the headset’s biggest draw, looking at this package.
If you squint, you’ll see an icon in the bottom left corner of the box, next to the one that reads “Low Latency Connection”. It reads “Battery Life” and “100 Hrs”. That should be a giant sticker. Maybe a colourful pop-up feature. Hell, each box should have a tiny wacky inflatable arm-waving guy, like the ones car dealerships use, holding up a “100 Hours!” sign. Because damn.
The headset alone is impressive. The soft black plastic construction is elegant and understated, simultaneously lightweight and sturdy. The memory-foam earpads, wrapped in a soft, sueded leatherette, are very comfortable. The microphone is one of the nicest I’ve experienced on a gaming headset, capturing very nice quality sound with little background noise.
