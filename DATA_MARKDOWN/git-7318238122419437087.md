Five people have been injured and more than a thousand evacuated from a theatre in London's West End after its roof partially collapsed on the audience.
In a brief statement, the Metropolitan Police said "a few people" suffered minor injures, while the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) later confirmed that five audience members had been taken to hospital for treatment.
The fire brigade said it had also evacuated around 1,100 people from the building.
