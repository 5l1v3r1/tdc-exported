Parking restrictions will also be in effect.Crews will work Monday through Friday, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The project is expected to last four weeks.SoCal Gas said people in homes and businesses nearby will likely hear some work-related noise.Some business managers believe the extra traffic will be a good thing."If anything, it's probably going to get better for us because they're going to get stuck in traffic right here," said Charli Phuvuvpa, General Manager of Sunset Car Wash.People in the area may smell gas, which the company said is normal when crews are working.Gas service interruptions are not anticipated.
