I was about 11 years old the first time I watched Charlie’s Angels.
I can’t say I liked it, exactly. I was mostly bored by it. This was around the same time that the GameBoy Colour was a very big deal in my life, and not long after the opening credits had rolled, I stopped giving the film my whole attention and started playing my Inspector Gadget platformer instead.
That is, until about three-quarters of the way through, when I suddenly noticed the film’s secret villain, Eric Knox, played by Sam Rockwell.
For most of the film, you’re meant to think that Knox is the love interest. He’s floppy-haired, funny, and sensitive — the proto-softboi. Then, all of a sudden, he throws off his long black dressing gown, lights a cigarette, pulls a gun, and shoots Drew Barrymore out of a window.
