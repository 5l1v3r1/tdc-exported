In the follow-up Q&A to Nintendo's six months earnings report, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been asked if the company would consider developing more remakes based on classic handheld IPs, now that the 3DS has seemingly been ditched and the Switch Lite is available.
This was his reply, courtesy of a translation via Siliconera:
Following this question, Furukawa was asked to break down the recent success of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Pokemon Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Let’s Go, Eevee! on the Switch.
He reiterated how creating new game experiences – even within remakes – was "more important" than nostalgia, and went on to explain how Link's Awakening managed to combine both:
In a rare western interview with TIME last month, the current Nintendo president said it was vital for development teams to "try something new" and have the "courage to step into unfamiliar territory" with their ideas.
