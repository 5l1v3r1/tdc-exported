Cape Town City shockingly announced the termination of Benni McCarthy’s contract at midnight and Siya sources have revealed that two coaches have already emerged as frontrunners for the job.
As previously reported by the Siya crew, City Chairman, John Comitis has been eyeing Muhsin Ertugral to come in as a replacement for McCarthy, should the head coach not agree to extend his stay at the club.

However, with City themselves deciding to terminate the 41-year-old’s contract, sources have revealed that Ertugral has now emerged as the number one candidate to take over the helm at the club.
The source added that Ertugral arrived in Cape Town on Friday, suggesting that his camp has been in talks with Comitis.
In addition, sources have indicated that former AmaZulu FC head coach, Cavin Johnson has also made it on the list of potential candidates. Johnson and City chairman, Comitis have previously worked together during their time at Ajax Cape Town and comes as no big surprise that the Citizens could possibly consider the 60-year-old.
City are expected to make announcement about a new head coach in the coming days and it remains to be seen who will be taking over the helm at the club.
