Today's contest features a Blu-ray copy of The Lion King -- come win it!
The original Lion King is definitely one of those big, epic animated films that really dominated the early part of my childhood. I of course loved Disney movies back then, but man the detail in the animation, the songs, the plot -- it all came together perfectly to make this really amazing movie that I can still watch to this day.
Disney's been trying to recreate the magic lately with semi live action remakes of old hand-animated movies. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Dumbo all had their shot -- now it's Simba's turn!
