        Ilhan Omar has recently endorsed Bernie Sanders, as have two other members of the so-called ‘Squad’, and she is rallying her base to vote for the Vermont senator and his progressive policies next year.
      
Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the leading Democratic congressional newcomers, has praised Bernie Sanders as a president that will fight “genocide” and “western imperialism.”
While it’s not precisely clear what Omar meant by the fight against “imperialism,” she might have been referring to Sanders’ campaign pledges to divert part of the “exorbitant” US defence spending to domestic issues and avoid maintaining “unnecessary overseas military bases.”
