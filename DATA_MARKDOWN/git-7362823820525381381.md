New York City voters on Tuesday decided to amend the city’s constitution, restructuring primary and special elections to operate under a new ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to rank their top five candidates on the ballot according to preference.
The plan had backing from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a businessman and New York City resident.

The new ballot structure will eliminate New York’s traditional runoff elections, which take place for citywide offices if no candidate garners at least 40 percent of the vote, Politico reported. New York City will adopt the new ranked-choice system in primary and special elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and city council beginning in January 2021.
Advocates such as Yang argued the system would free voters to cast ballots for third parties and pick the candidates they truly prefer rather than strategically go for the Republican for Democrat.
