FKA twigs has opened up about her ongoing mental health struggles, saying that “it’s okay not to feel amazing all the time”.
The artist, whose real name is Tahlia Barnet, spoke to BBC Radio 1’s Annie Mac following the release of her new single ‘Sad Day‘. During the chat, twigs explained that she’s become more at ease with herself in recent years.
“It’s becoming apparent as I get older and as I get to know myself, it’s okay not to feel amazing all the time,” she told Mac.
“It’s okay for me, as a woman of colour, not to feel like a Nubian queen all the time, who’s perfectly sitting on my throne of greatness.”
twigs continued: “It’s just not my reality, but yet I know that I’m still perfect the way that I am, and I know that I still can do whatever I want, and I can dream big and I can achieve my dreams. And that has nothing to do with my completeness in the moment.”
