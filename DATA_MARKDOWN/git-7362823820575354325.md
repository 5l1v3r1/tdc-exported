The founder of Spanx is hopelessly devoted to Olivia Newton-John’s pants.
Sara Blakely, who founded the shapewear brand in 2000, has revealed herself as the new owner of the skintight satin pants Olivia Newton-John famously wore while portraying Sandy Olsson in the 1978 film adaptation of “Grease.”

The pants, along with the leather jacket that Newton-John wore during the finale of the film, were auctioned off on Saturday for $162,500 and $243,200, respectively. The items were among hundreds up for bid from the personal collection of Newton-John, 71, who was selling the pieces in an effort to raise money for her Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Australia.
Blakely revealed herself as the winning bidder of the pants — as well as one of the film’s Pink Ladies jackets — on “CBS This Morning,” where she claimed she intends to frame the pants in the Spanx headquarters in Atlanta.
