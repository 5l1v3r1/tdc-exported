David Byrne posts monthly themed playlists on his website and November’s is “Indie Pop.” Here’s what he says:
It is on the shorter side, and includes Billie Eilish, Vagabon, Michael Kiwanuka, serpentwithfeet, Bon Iver, Brittany Howard, Kelsey Lu, Hobo Johnson and more. There are also two songs by the mathy black midi, which don’t exactly fit with the rest of this otherwise smooth playlist, but who are we to tell David Byrne what to include? Also one of the black midi songs is titled “Talking Heads” so…listen over at David’s website.
Meanwhile, David Byrne’s American Utopia is on Broadway now and the run was recently extended through February 16.
