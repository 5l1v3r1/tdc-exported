        "Fucking hell these politicians are actual aliens."
      
Stormzy has called on Jacob Rees-Mogg to resign as an MP, after he seemingly suggested that the victims of the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked “common sense” for not fleeing the building.
The Tory MP was condemned earlier today (November 5) after he told LBC host Nick Ferrari that the 72 victims of the blaze would have survived if they had ignored the fire brigade’s orders to stay put.
Sharing a clip of Rees Mogg’s comments on Twitter, Stormzy wrote: “Oi @Jacob_Rees_Mogg. You need to resign you’re an actual piece of shit, I beg everyone watch this.MP Jacob Rees Mogg in a nutshell saying Grenfell Victims should of [sic] had the common sense to escape. I can’t believe the cheek, fucking hell these politicians are actual aliens.”
He added: “My man said ‘if either of us were in fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we’d leave a burning building’ as if to say ‘come on bro, they were just dumb’ as if those who lost their lives weren’t smart enough to escape. Fucking hell this man is the scummiest.”
