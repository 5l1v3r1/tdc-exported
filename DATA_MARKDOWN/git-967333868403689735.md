According to the ex-diplomat, Washington should first and foremost change its stance on Crimea's status so that it can review its sanction policy against Russia.
In addition, Ortblad offered two solutions for how to heal ties with Russia: reducing the nuclear threat and reconsidering the role of NATO, as well as increasing student exchanges.
Relations between Russia and the West deteriorated after Crimea rejoined Russia following the 2014 referendum, where over 96 percent of voters supported the reunification. Western countries have accused the Kremlin of interfering in the vote and introduced sanctions against Russia. Moscow retaliated by switching over to an import phase-out and imposing countersanctions.
