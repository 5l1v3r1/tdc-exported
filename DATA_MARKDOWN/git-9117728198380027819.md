        In qualifying, drivers were able to take some wide lines around the Circuit of the Americas. Especially at turn eight where a number of drivers ran wide and might have gained an advantage. One of those yellow sausage kerbs has now been added to the wider line. 
      
Drivers can still attack the apex, but can't go fully off the track unless they fancy taking a ride over the sausage kerb. The placement of the curb in turn eight is tactically done. 
Times were deleted for wide running at turn 19. If a driver does this three times during the United States Grand Prix, they will be given a black and white flag. 
What is important here is that if a driver leaves the track, he must return in a way that is considered safe. Also, no obvious benefit may be gained.
