        A Bloomberg journalist who published a ‘bitcoin manipulation FUD’ article yesterday was called out for promoting Satoshi Nakamoto wannabes in June last year. 
      
One of Bloomberg’s journalists, going by the name of Matt Leising, caught the attention of the bitcoin and crypto Twitter community yesterday for his latest article on a ‘new Tether FUD’. However, it didn’t stop there. Folks left no time in lashing out at the gentleman for his ‘faketoshi wannabe’ articles from 2018.
