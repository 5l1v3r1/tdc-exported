President Trump is planning to become the first sitting U.S. president to attend a UFC fight, when he makes the trip to Madison Square Garden to see Masvidal and Diaz square off at UFC 244.
Masvidal, a Miami native of Cuban descent, praised Trump and seemed to relish the opportunity to fight in front of him. He also took the opportunity t0 land some verbal strikes on noted Trump supporter and fellow UFC fighter Colby Covington.
“I think real recognize real,” Masvidal said. “No matter what your views are on Trump as a president, the guy’s a bad motherf*ck*r, man. The money that he’s made, the obstacles that he’s conquered. He’s a bad motherf*ck*r in his own way. No matter what your political views are. Who’s he coming to see? It’s not that c*cks*ck*r with a MAGA hat talking about ‘Trump this, Trump that.’
“And (Covington) don’t know sh*t about politics. I’m not going to sit here and talk about politics or act like I know about it, but I ain’t going to try to sell people that I know about politics. That motherf*ck*r can’t even spell the nation’s capital. Inbred-ass retard.”
