Kevin-Prince Boateng says “nothing has changed” in football’s fight against racism since he walked off a pitch almost seven years ago, in the wake of the abuse suffered by Mario Balotelli.
Brescia striker Balotelli threatened to leave the field during the second half of Sunday’s Serie A defeat at Verona because of apparent racist chanting from home fans.
In similar circumstances, Boateng, who currently plays for Italian club Fiorentina, refused to continue playing a friendly for AC Milan against Pro Patria in January 2013 in protest at racist abuse from the terraces.
