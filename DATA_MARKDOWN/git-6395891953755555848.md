NEW BEDFORD, Mass. - National Transportation Safety Board investigators have been in New Bedford for nearly 24 hours as they look into the cause of a crash that killed a 74-year-old pilot.
Heavy rain wasn't making it any easier for investigators to get some answers Tuesday evening. 
Witnesses have different opinions on what that plane was doing in the sky before it crashed and the NTSB warned people to be careful when it comes to speculation about that plane doing aerobic circles before it crashed. 
Onlookers lined up in New Bedford's Rural Cemetery to catch a view of the mangled metal left behind. 
The pilot, Paul Vidal, took off in his Cessna 150 from the local airport around four miles away.
A passionate and experienced pilot, his wife described him as careful in the cockpit and someone who would take the lives of others into consideration if he had any problems in the sky.
