Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., came to the defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on Monday after the progressive congresswoman received multiple death threats on Twitter.
Over the weekend, Omar put a spotlight on the threats she had received from other Twitter users, telling the social media giant that the posts about her were "unacceptable." One tweet had called her a "terrorist" who "should be hanged for treason."
Cruz expressed solidarity with Omar amid the viral threats.
"This is reprehensible," Cruz tweeted. "Disagree with @IlhanMN on the merits, fine, but death threats to anyone are not a joke."
