By street view, this cemetery almost looks like an ordinary park. But a closer inspection reveals history hidden in plain sight.
Savannah Memorial Park is also known as Savannah Pioneer Cemetery, El Monte Cemetery, and California Historical Landmark #1046. The cemetery was founded in 1851 with some graves dating back even further.
Due to recent California drought restrictions, the landscape of the park is not lush and green like a conventional cemetery. The results of these restrictions have transformed the land to resemble a more natural terrain similar to the pioneer era. Old trees scatter dead flowers like confetti over the weathered monuments and tombstones.
Most of the graves belong to pioneers of Rosemead and various other neighborhoods of the San Gabriel Valley. Decedents of these families are still being interred today. Local lore also suggests that Savannah Memorial Park is a site for unexplained paranormal activity. 
There is no staff or caretaker on site.
