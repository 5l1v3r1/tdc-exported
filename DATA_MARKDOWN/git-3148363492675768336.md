“This voluntary recall only covers specific batch codes of the following products, which include ready-to-bake refrigerated Nestlé Toll House Cookie Dough bars, tubs, and tube-shaped ‘chubs.’ These products were distributed in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico,” the announcement posted by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration read.
The voluntarily recalled products are listed as:
Products not affected by the recall are Nestlé Toll House Morsels, Nestlé Toll House Ice Cream Sandwiches, Nestlé Toll House Edible Cookie Dough, and Nestlé Professional SKUs.
“To identify the batch code on the package, Nestlé released reference images and highlighted the four-digit batch code where it appears after the ‘use or freeze-by’ date and before the number 5753,” according to ABC News.
However, Nestlé said in a recent statement that the source of the rubber had been identified and the problem resolved.
“No illnesses or injuries have been reported that required medical treatment,” the company said, adding that it implemented the voluntary recall “out of an abundance of caution after receiving reports of food-grade pieces of rubber in some of these products.”
Nestlé also encouraged anyone who purchased one or more of the products listed to discard it, keep their proof of purchase, and contact Consumer Services at nestleproductinquiry@casupport.com.
