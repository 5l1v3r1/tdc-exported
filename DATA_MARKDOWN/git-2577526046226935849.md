The showrunners behind Netflix’s Witcher series have made clear that they’re drawing from the fantasy book series rather than CDPR’s RPG trilogy. For my money, that’s the right idea, offering a far more grounded way in to Geralt’s adventures than his amnesia-riddled romp through The Witcher 1 and 2. However, the new trailer for the series, which dropped last night, does raise a question: If Netflix is focusing on the books, where did that tub Geralt scene come from, hmm?
Yesterday’s trailer, which debuted at Lucca Comics 2019, is a whistle stop tour of the short stories that help set up the world of the Witcher. The biggest narrative thread it offers would appear to be the First War with Nilfgaard, culminating in what looks like the southern empire’s conquering of Cintra.
