New York State Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla ordered Trump on Thursday to pay a stiff sum to a group of charities that claimed the Trump Foundation violated the state's charities laws.
The lawsuit was filed in June 2018 by the office of New York's then-attorney general, Barbara Underwood, over the issue of the Trump Foundation collecting political donations for Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, which she characterized as "extensive unlawful political coordination."
Accordingly, the $2 million to be paid by the president himself, as well as the $1.78 million in foundation assets, will be distributed equally to eight charities: Army Emergency Relief, the Children’s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha’s Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of National Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.
"No one is above the law - not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States," James said.
