You might remember a decade ago when everyone wanted a digital photo frame, but those devices were all junk. In the era of smart displays, we finally haveÂ good digital photo frames powered by Google Photos that happen to do a lot of other things, too. The experience is getting a bit better today with the addition of dates in the photo slideshow. However, they only appear on some photos.
When you set up a smart display, Google lets you choose if you want the ambient display to show a generic art gallery, a digital clock, or your own photos. If you choose your own photos, you can let Google randomly use recent highlights or pull from a specific album. Before today, every photo included the owner/uploader and album name in the lower right corner. Now, some of the photos have the date and number of years ago they were taken.
