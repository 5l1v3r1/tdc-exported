Essex Police have revealed that they have spoken by telephone to fugitive Ronan Hughes who they want to question over the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex.
Ronan Hughes, and his brother Christopher, 34, both from Co Armagh were named earlier this week as people the police wanted to speak to in connection with the deaths.
Officer Daniel Stoten made an appeal for the pair to hand themselves in.
Maurice Robinson, 25, has already appeared before an Essex court accused of the manslaughter of the 39 migrants.
Speaking yesterday, Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart Hooper, who is leading the investigation, said: “Finding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to our investigation.
“At this time we believe they are in Northern Ireland but they also have links to the Irish Republic."
