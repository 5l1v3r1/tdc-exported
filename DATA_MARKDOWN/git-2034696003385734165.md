A new Scream movie is reportedly in production.
The new film would follow 2011’s Scream 4 and, according to Bloody Disgusting, Spyglass Media is developing the next film in the series – even after the passing of creator Wes Craven.
Variety previously explained how Spyglass came to get the rights to produce a new Scream film, writing: “Spyglass Media Group was re-launched as a content company in March by former MGM topper Barber, Lantern Entertainment co-presidents Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic and strategic investors Eagle Pictures and Cineworld Group.”
