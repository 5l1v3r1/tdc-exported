Topline: Almost 80% of Chinese shoppers said in a new survey that they will boycott American goods during Singles’ Day—the world’s largest online shopping event—on November 11, as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war increasingly gives rise to nationalistic sentiment that is trickling into the retail industry.
Big numbers: In 2018, Black Friday sales amounted to $6.2 billion, Cyber Monday sales hit $7.9 billion and shoppers spent roughly $4.2 billion on Amazon Prime Day—but none of those come close to the $30.8 billion of transactions (in gross merchandise volume) spent on Alibaba’s Singles’ Day last year.
Crucial quote: “Chinese consumers … prefer local brands, and the recent rise in pro-China feeling has only pushed this further,” AlixPartners’ director Jason Ong said in the South China Morning Post.
