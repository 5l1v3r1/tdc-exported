Blizzard posted a teaser for its new Hearthstone expansion on social media before following it up with a full reveal at BlizzCon 2019. The next Hearthstone expansion, Descent of Dragons, will conclude the story started with Rise of Shadows and Saviors of Uldum. This tale is wrapped up in a very Flash Gordon candy shell, with an accompanying music video.
This expansion takes us to Dragonblight, a zone from World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. Dragonblight is up in snowy Northrend, and itâ€™s where the Dragon Aspects gather near their shrines. There are also lots of dead dragons, so we can expect some potentially spooky cards ... like Galakrond, the massive skeleton that dominates the landscape of Dragonblight.
