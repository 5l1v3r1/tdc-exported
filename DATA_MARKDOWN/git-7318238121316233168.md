Severe rain and wind has managed to move a massive iron scow that has been stuck on a rocky perch near Niagara Falls since 1918.
For 101 years the dumping scow was considered to be an unmovable landmark ⁠— until it dislodged on Thursday, according to Niagara Parks. The dinghy, which has deteriorated over the last century, appeared to have flipped over and spun on its side.
