Kacey Musgraves is joining the likes of Dolly Parton, John Denver, Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash, in the country music tradition of having her own Christmas special. The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show will debut on Amazon Prime on November 29 (the day after Thanksgiving) and it features a very Kacey Musgraves group of guests: Lana Del Rey, Dan Levy (Schitt’s Creek, who also directs the special), Kendall Jenner, Zooey Deschanel, Fred Armisen, Leon Bridges, Troye Sivan, James Corden, Camila Cabello, and the Radio City Rockettes. Says Kacey:
You can watch the campy, fun trailer for the special below. There will be an official soundtrack released for The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show on 11/29 as well.
Speaking of Kacey and Radio City, she played there just a few weeks ago.
