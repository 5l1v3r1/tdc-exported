If you’ve played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for long enough, then you’ve probably learned how to handle a Lynel just fine. Even so, there are levels to how good you can be at the game.
Take this short clip uploaded by @zb_yuhudaddy to Twitter, for instance. It begins with the sort of thing you might expect: a parry, some slo-mo hits, what have you. Then he throws the tri-boomerang to swirl around the Lynel. And then he masterfully dodges while leaving a bomb in the Lynel’s attack route. All the while, the boomerang continues to work its magic.
