The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed in its latest employment report for October that while Americans enjoy continued 50-year-low unemployment thanks to President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy, there is still no labor shortage for employers.
Overall, there are about 5.9 million unemployed Americans — including 726,000 American teenagers, 319,000 black Americans, and 242,000 Hispanics, all of whom want full-time jobs. Of those unemployed, about 1.3 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks.
Likewise, about 4.4 million Americans are working part-time jobs but want full-time employment. Another 1.2 million Americans are not in the labor force at all, though they want full-time jobs as well and had searched for jobs within the last year.
Of those Americans not in the labor force, 341,000 told the Labor Department that they were discouraged by their job prospects and believe there are no jobs for them.
