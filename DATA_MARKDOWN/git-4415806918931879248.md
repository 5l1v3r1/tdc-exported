A housing estate was blocked with burning cars, a car was driven onto a bonfire and fire fighters came under attack during a series of Halloween call-outs in Dublin last night.
144 incidents were logged by 9pm.
The Dublin Fire Brigade says it came under attack as crews tried to put out two cars that had been set alight in the middle of a road in Darndale last night.
