The upmove in the market has been supported by positive global markets, strong buying by overseas investors, and better-than-expected corporate earnings. In the past five sessions, foreign portfolio investors have pumped in nearly Rs 12,000 crore into domestic stocks. According to Bloomberg data, 18 out of 28 Nifty firms that have reported quarterly earnings have surpassed or matched the average analysts estimates. ­
