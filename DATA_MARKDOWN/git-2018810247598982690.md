The review embargo for Death Stranding is finally up, which means I'm now allowed to talk about the genuinely disturbing tale of what the hell all those babies are for in Death Stranding, and how they got there in the first place.
The world was given a first look at the bridge babies in the initial Death Stranding trailer, when Sam (Norman Reedus) is on a shore. We got a better look at them in the game's second showing at The Game Awards in 2016, however, when Deadman (Guillermo del Toro) plugs into a baby while a tank rolls overhead.
