Chevron Corp reported a 36per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday as the oil major was hit by lower oil and gas prices due to record shale oil output in North America and a slowing global economy.
REUTERS: Chevron Corp reported a 36per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday as the oil major was hit by lower oil and gas prices due to record shale oil output in North America and a slowing global economy.
Net income attributable to the company fell to US$2.58 billion, or US$1.36 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from US$4.05 billion, or US$2.11 per share a year earlier.
Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production grew about 3per cent to 3.03 million barrels per day, but average sales prices fell both in the United States and internationally.
