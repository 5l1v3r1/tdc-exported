Amir Khan (@AmirKhanStuff) is a comedian based in New York City but originally from Miami. He performs with his improv team, Promises, at UCB Hell’s Kitchen in New York. He also performs monthly with the Asian AF New York team at UCB.
This week, Amir and I talked supportive improv teams, young moms, and being a full-on dumbass.
