        Campaigning is under way for the General Election on 12 December. Labour launched its campaign last week but the Tories are keeping their powder dry until Wednesday. Sputnik takes a look at who will be running their campaign.
      
Paul Stephenson, who masterminded Vote Leave’s media strategy during the 2016 Brexit referendum, has arrived to join Boris Johnson’s election campaign team.
Stephenson is taking unpaid leave from his consultancy firm, Hanbury Strategy, to help Johnson win the election and get a majority big enough for him to push his Brexit withdrawal bill through Parliament.
