        "[It] really set me back"
      
Pharrell Williams has reflected on the ‘Blurred Lines’ copyright case in a new interview, revealing that he disagrees with the verdict.
Back in 2015, a federal jury ruled that Robin Thicke and Williams’ hit single shared similarities to Marvin Gaye‘s ‘Got To Give It Up’ (1977), and that the two artists must pay half of the song’s royalties Gaye’s family. They were also made to make a one-off payment of $5.3m (£4m) in damages.
Speaking with GQ about the lengthy legal battle, Williams has now claimed that the 2013 song only shares a “feeling” with the classic track.
“It hurt my feelings because I would never take anything from anyone. And that really set me back,” the star explained to Rick Rubin in the new video.
After Rubin adds that ‘Blurred Lines’ sounds “nothing like” ‘Got To Give It Up’, Williams replied: “Nope. But the feeling was. You can’t copyright a feeling… All salsa songs sound pretty much the same.”
