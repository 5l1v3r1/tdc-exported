Lahren had a field day on Dem presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, who announced the end of his presidential campaign on 1 November.
"Bee-too, Bet-oh, Bay-toe, real name Robert Francis O’Rourke, you can call him a lot of names but Mr. President is not one of them," the 27-year old host said in her opening remarks for Fox Nation’s “No interruption.”
O’Rourke, notorious for his vocal support for common-sense gun regulation and, in some cases, gun confiscation, is a Texan by birth, which is one of the most pro-gun states. On Friday, ‘Beto’ announced the end his campaign by saying “it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully."
US President Trump reacted to the announcement in a comparatively reserved tweet.
