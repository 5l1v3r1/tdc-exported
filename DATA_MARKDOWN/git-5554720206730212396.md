The news of CISF personnel stumbling upon potential RDX explosives at the international terminal of the Delhi Airport sent shockwaves across the national capital on Friday. According to a statement by the CISF, one of its constables, identified as VK Singh, had spotted an unattended trolley bag outside the arrival gate around 1 AM.
Singh immediately informed his shift in-charge and other senior officers. “Immediately, EVD check of the same was carried out and found positive signals of RDX inside the bag. The baggage was also checked by Dog ‘Guide’, which also gave positive signal for explosives,” the statement from CISF read.
A Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) team was called in and the area was cordoned off. Movement of vehicles and passengers were also stopped for more than three hours.
