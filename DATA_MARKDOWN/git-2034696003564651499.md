A rare copy of the Sex Pistols‘ single ‘God Save the Queen’ on vinyl fetched £13K at auction last week.
The record went under the hammer at Wessex Auction Rooms at Westbrook Farm in Chippenham last Friday (November 1) and was expected to fetch between £12,000-£15,000.
The record was described by the auctioneers as “a superb copy of one of the rarest and most sought after records in the world. Contained in original A&M sleeve, and within card sleeve with A&M Records sticker.”
The single was originally recorded for A&M Records in 1977. The label dropped the band before it was released and most of the copies were destroyed. Martin Hughes, of Wessex Auction Rooms near Chippenham.
Speaking to the Swindon Advertiser, Hughes said: “I have had the privilege of selling many rare records but this is certainly the most exciting of them all.
“The Sex Pistols will always be the most iconic punk band, and perhaps also one of the most culturally significant. This is a chance for a collector to own a piece of music history.”
