        Turkey’s state-backed digital asset, the crypto lira or digital lira is scheduled for launch next year. The move has the potential to bring about a heightened interest in government-backed or other large-scale digital coin launches, by various other countries/corporations. 
      
Social media reports suggest that 2020 may be the year when Turkey launches its digital currency. The decision arrives after months of price weakness for the original lira.
