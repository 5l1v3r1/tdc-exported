Two people have been arrested in Hyderabad for allegedly trying to bury a newborn girl in a pit after claiming she was dead. 
The men aroused the suspicion of a passing motorist who found them digging up the road near a bus stop while trying to hide their identity.
“Just as we were informed, we arrived at the location immediately and found that the bag these men were carrying, had a baby in it," he added.
The incident was captured in a video showing policemen questioning the two men.
