Margarita Santos, of 1664 Onyx St., San Andres Bukid, was killed on the spot while the suspect escaped aboard his plateless motorcycle.
The Manila Police District-Crimes Against Persons Investigation Section (MPD-CAPIS) said that the incident took place at around 10 p.m. at a wake being held near the corner of Onyx and Estrada Streets.
The victim was reportedly playing cards with two friends when the suspect arrived and shot her at close range, hitting her in the left cheek.
The suspect then sped away toward Zobel Roxas Street while the victim was brought to the hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.Â
