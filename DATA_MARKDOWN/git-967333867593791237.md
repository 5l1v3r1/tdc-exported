Bankrupt gold bullion dealer James Stunt apologised on Saturday to Prince Charles, whom he call a "friend," over allegations that he loaned "forged" artworks, including by Monet and Picasso, to the prince's charity.
An agreement for a 10-year free lease of 17 artworks to Dumfries House was signed by Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles’ former valet who is now chief executive of The Prince’s Foundation.
US art forger Tony Tetro, however, claimed in a comment to the Daily Mail that three paintings out of the loaned 17, including "Monet's" water lilies are his forgeries.
According to the outlet, two other works by "Picasso" and "Dali" are also forgeries.
The incident deepened on Sunday amid reports that Stunt could have loaned other works to the Palace of Westminster with one of them being on display in the House of Lords.
