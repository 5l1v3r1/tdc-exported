SOMERVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Somerset County is offering free hepatitis A vaccinations after a deli worker at a supermarket was found to have the virus.
The vaccinations will be given at the county health department from noon to 8 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday.
Officials say the Somerville ShopRite was contagious with the virus between Oct. 13 and Oct. 30. Officials say anyone who bought food from the deli should throw it away.
Hepatitis A is usually spread when a person comes into contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by an infected person.
State health officials have confirmed 533 hepatitis A infections this year, including six deaths.
