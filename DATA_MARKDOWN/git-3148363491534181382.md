The occupants of the caravan fired rounds in the air and exchanged gunfire with several individuals in other vehicles. According to Breitbart Texas law enforcement sources, the violence began when the convoy pursued a vehicle, firing multiple rounds. The targeted driver eventually crashed into a wall. The driver presumably fled on foot as the convoy continued to patrol the city, firing at specific targets.
The convoy reportedly patrolled the city for at least one hour, torching several vehicles and leaving at least two dead. A cell phone video released on social media captured the sounds of the early morning incident.
