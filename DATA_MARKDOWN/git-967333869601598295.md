        WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - California has appointed an energy czar to develop a plan for a possible state takeover of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) after the utility company left millions in the dark during recent wildfires, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
      
Wildfires raged across California this month due to strong winds that forced PG&E to leave around 1.5 million without power. A state regulator launched a probe on Monday into the unprecedented number of so-called Public Safety Power Shut-offs (PSPS) as wildfires threatened California residents.
Long and widespread blackouts highlighted PG&E's "culture of ineptitude" and resistance to change, the governor added.
