Sergio Busquets came on from the bench for Barcelona during their 3-1 defeat by Levante. He was not too self-critical on behalf of the team when it came to speaking about the game.
"There's little explanation you can give, other than that it was a very even game where we did the difficult thing, which was going ahead on the scoreboard," said the midfielder.
"They had a burst of 10 minutes in the second half and did us a lot of damage, making the game almost impossible. These things happen in football, and although they ended our run we have no other choice but continuing."
He added: "The result was excessive."
