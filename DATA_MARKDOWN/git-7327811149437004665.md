Thanksgiving may be weeks away, but you can start your Black Friday shopping on eBay right now.
Every Friday now through December 13, eBay will post the 'deal of the day' at 9 a.m. and you can make use of it as long as supplies last.
Prices are unveiled on the day of each deal, and the items also ship for free.
