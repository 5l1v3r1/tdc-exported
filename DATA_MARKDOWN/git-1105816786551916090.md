The general secretary of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s (JUI-F) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter, Ataul Haq Darvesh, mistakenly urged the Azadi March protesters to chant “Go Nawaz Go” instead of “Go Imran Go.”
In the footage which has since gone viral, Darvesh can be seen addressing protesters from the main stage of the Azadi March under way in the federal capital.
Darvesh, however, soon retracted his words as other leaders intervened to correct him.
The chant against the former three-time premier Nawaz Sharif gained countrywide popularity during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) 2014 sit-in.
Prime Minister Imran Khan is now on the receiving end of a similar challenge as thousands of protesters have converged on the federal capital with their main demand being the PM’s resignation.
Azadi marchers began their journey to Islamabad from Sindh and  reached Islamabad on Thursday.
Fiery speeches have been given against the PTI-led government with the prime minister given a 48-hour ultimatum to step down after which protesters have threatened to march on the PM House to forcefully arrest him.
