SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old Indian worker was killed and a Bangladeshi worker injured after a crane collapsed on Monday (Nov 4) at the construction site of a new rehab facility under Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it received a call for help at a construction site in Jalan Tan Tock Seng in Novena at about 8.50am.
One man was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics, it said.
Another man, aged 35, was taken conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital after the incident, the police said.
Police investigations are ongoing, they added.
When CNA's reporter arrived at the scene, part of the tower crane – roughly the height of a 10-storey building – had collapsed and was bent at an angle.
