“The pain is still here,” she told the station.
Wayne Williams was given two life sentences in 1982 for convictions in the deaths of two adults, thought to be among 29 black children and young adults killed. Police blamed him for the other killings but never charged him.
There has been a renewed push to re-examine evidence in the case.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Police Chief Erika Shields announced in March that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Fulton County District Attorney will review evidence in the “Atlanta Child Murders” cases to see if any of it can be tested further.
