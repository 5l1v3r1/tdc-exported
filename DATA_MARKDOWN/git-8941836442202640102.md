Mickey Rourke says it’s only a matter of time before he delivers a “left hook from hell” to President Trump.
The man who played Ivan Vanko in “Iron Man 2” told an entertainment website this week that Mr. Trump is “gonna feel” his fists after leaving office.
“It’s personal,” he told TooFab of a lawsuit for damage inside a Trump hotel room in the 1990s. “There’s gonna be a day where he ain’t president, and we’re gonna bump into each other. And you’re gonna feel me.”
The lawsuit also included deceased rapper Tupac Shakur.
“You know what happens?’ he continued Wednesday from Los Angeles. “What goes up, goes down. And when it goes down, it goes down like a motherf—er,” he added. “That’s the life we live in. … He’s gonna feel me. You hear me? You’re gonna feel me. What you said about us? On my brother — you’re gonna feel me.”
Mr. Rourke, 67, was once a professional boxer.
