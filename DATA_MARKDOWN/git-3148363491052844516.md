Springer made the comments in a discussion with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle over the weekend about whether civil norms are breaking down in the modern era.
“I used to joke and say that my anger at the president is that he took my show and brought it to the White House,” Springer said. “Civility is critical in terms of our norms, and we can’t function as a society unless we have norms of how to behave. You can’t pass enough laws to take care of every human interaction.”
