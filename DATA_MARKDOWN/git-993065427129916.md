Chris Brown says he is having a high-end garage sale at his Los Angeles home, and a crowd has been gathering for hours.
The singer posted a flyer on his Instagram and Twitter accounts that included his home address in the Tarzana neighbourhood, and says the event started at 10am Wednesday and will go on until 7pm.
The flyer says the sale will feature “significantly marked-down high-end designer items”.
