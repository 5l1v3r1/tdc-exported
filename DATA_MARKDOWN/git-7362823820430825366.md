It’s just like the old saying goes – the way to a Tinder date’s heart may be through their stomach.
An ambitious young man attempted to woo a woman he met through a dating app by showing off his pasta-making skills on Twitter, in a saga that has since gone viral online, as dozens of commenters root for sparks to fly.
On Thursday, a Twitter account called "Tortellinis for Tilly" shared a six-step guide with photos on how to make the ring-shaped pasta from scratch.
