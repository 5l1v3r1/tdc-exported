Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has been live for a little more than a week, and most players are beginning to dig into its meaty list of multiplayer weapons. Already some weird quirks are emerging, including a few guns that fire less accurately when the player is crouched. There’s also apparently a double-barreled shotgun with extraordinary range. If you’re hoping to dive in this week, here’s a handful of weapons to keep an eye on.
Part of getting used to a gun in a modern first-person shooter is familiarizing yourself with its recoil pattern. As rounds are fired, the barrel tends to rise and drift left or right off the centerline. Crouching can limit that movement considerably, and that’s certainly the case in Modern Warfare... unless you’re using the Kilo 141 assault rifle, the M-13 assault rifle, or the MP-5 sub-machine gun.
As YouTuber E-Roc shows in the video below, those weapons work the other way around. They’re actually more accurate when you’re standing.
