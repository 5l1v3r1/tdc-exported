When introducing Overwatch 2 during the Blizzcon opening keynote, game director Jeff Kaplan joked about forgetting his lines â€” but it was fine because the internet had revealed everything he was going to say anyway. But in a follow-up interview with Kotaku Australia, Kaplan went into detail about just how demoralising the leaks were for those working on the game.
Overwatch 2 wasn't the only game thoroughly leaked before the show, of course. Its announcement was effectively pencilled in from June, when sources told Kotaku that work on a Starcraft shooter in the Overwatch engine, along with an unannounced mobile game, had been cancelled to prioritise development on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2. In the fortnight leading up to Blizzcon, word got out about some of the game's PvE design, including a screenshot of Tracer's unlockable abilities that would later prove to be on the money.
If that wasn't bad enough, some of the major story beats from Zero Hour, the cinematic introduction to Overwatch 2, were leaked as well.
