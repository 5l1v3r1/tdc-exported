Plymouth Argyle's League Two game against Grimsby Town this afternoon has been postponed.
Significant damage to the roof of Home Park was caused by severe winds overnight, making parts of the stadium unsafe for sectators.
With winds still gusting to gale-force at times, it has been impossible to safely access the roof to make repairs.
A cluib statement issued shortly before 12.30pm read: "With supporters' safety of paramount concern, and following consultation with the police and safety experts, we have been advised that we are not allowed to open the stadium.
"Therefore, regrettably we have been left with no option but to call off the game.
"In keeping with the rest of Home Park, the roof was assessed during the summer and passed independent stringent safety and structural tests.
"We are content that the overnight damage was unavoidable.
"Details of the re-arranged fixture and associated ticketing information will be released as soon as we have them.
"Tickets for the match will be valid for the re-scheduled game."
