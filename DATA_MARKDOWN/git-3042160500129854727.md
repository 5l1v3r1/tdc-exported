A Michigan brewing company has reached a settlement with a Black former employee who said he was fired for bringing to light a culture of racism at the business.
Founders Brewing Co. published both a company statement and one from ex-employee Tracy Evans on its website Thursday.
“I am not going to say too much here,” Evans said, “but I want the world to know the power we have when we step forward and make ourselves heard.”
