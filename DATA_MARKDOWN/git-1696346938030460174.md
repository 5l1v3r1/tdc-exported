        Bitcoin price might move in a sideways trend until the next halving. Then, it might finally explode to new all-time-highs, according to a Twitter user who applies the stock-to-flow ratio model.
      
Previously, we reported on bitcoin price forecasts that used the stock-to-flow (SF) ratio model, which was initially proposed by Twitter-based crypto and commodities analyst PlanB.
The stock-to-flow (SF) ratio typically applies to commodities. In the case of bitcoin, the ratio was calculated by dividing the current supply by the number of coins generated per given period. In other words, the scarcity or abundance level of BTC was visualized.
A Twitter user recently used the same model to spot an interesting pattern. The repetitive behavior relates to bitcoin’s upcoming halving event when the block reward will reduce by 50 percent. Specifically, it seems that the bitcoin price deviation in relation to its SF ratio converges to an imaginary equilibrium line until the halving event disrupts it and pushes to new highs.
