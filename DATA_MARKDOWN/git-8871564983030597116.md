“Mabuhay, Philippines!” Thai rapper, singer, and K-pop phenom Lalisa Manoban — better known by her mononym Lisa — greeted her Filipino fans today, confirming rumors that she’s the new ambassador of the Filipino-owned global clothing brand Penshoppe.
For those who’ve never heard of Lisa, or her girl group Black Pink, try being 10 years younger. Failing that, you can also briefly browse this YouTube dance compilation of the South Korean girl group member performing various twirls, pop-locks, and graceful limb extensions. She has a deeply devoted fanbase, which explains why that video alone has over 45 million views.
Black Pink is relatively new to the K-pop scene, having debuted their first album Square One in 2016. Despite their newbie status, their 2019 single “Kill This Love” has become a favorite on Spotify and on YouTube, where it has over 640 million hits.
