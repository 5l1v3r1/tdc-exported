        Late-night hosts take a closer look at the House’s vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry into the president
      
On Thursday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the day’s big news out of Washington: the House vote to formalize the impeachment process against Donald Trump, which means America is “one step closer to getting Trump out of the White House”. The resolution passed 232-196, led by Colbert’s guest of the evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. No Republicans supported the measure, leaving Colbert to wonder: “Are they just complaining about process with those zero votes? Or are they really so lacking any honor that they are willing to publicly state that blackmailing a foreign government to interfere in our election is OK?”
