Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday admitted that the national capital had turned into a gas chamber due to rising levels of pollution. He said that private and government-run schools in Delhi had begun distributing masks.
Kejriwal wrote on Twitter, “Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today I urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed.”
