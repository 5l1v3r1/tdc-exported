The left-wing Hollywood star and activist was arrested again in Washington D.C. as part of her ongoing series of weekly climate protests. It marks the fourth time in four weeks that Fonda has been apprehended by authorities since announcing that she was taking a break from Hollywood and devoting herself to “climate justice.”
On Friday, Fonda was arrested with a new cast of characters including actresses Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Keener.
