Though we're now in the last quarter of 2019, there's still a lot to look forward to on the horizon. The likes of Metro Exodus and Devil May Cry 5 have blown us away over the last few months, and we've still got titles such as Pokémon Sword And Shield and Cyberpunk 2077 to come - just to name a few. 
It's exhausting trying to keep up with all the new releases on the way, so we've decided to do the hard work for you and round up all of the biggest and best games on the way this year, next year, and even a few that might be further off than that. We've done our best to include games from across all the main consoles and PC, listed in release date order.
If you'd rather find out about great games that are already actually out, your best bet is to check out our individual guides to the best games on the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Switch.
