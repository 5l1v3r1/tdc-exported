Venezuela ordered El Salvador's diplomats to leave the country in reprisal for President Nayib Bukele's expulsion of officials representing the government in Caracas.
El Salvador does not recognise Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as legitimate and said on Saturday it would receive a new diplomatic corps representing opposition leader, Juan Guaido.
Guaido, who presides over the opposition-controlled National Assembly in January invoked the South American country's constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro stole the 2018 election.
He has been recognised by dozens of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Colombia and Chile. 
In response, the Venezuelan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday it declared each of the Salvadoran diplomatic staff in Caracas persona non grata and gave them 48 hours to leave.
"Salvadoran authorities are breathing oxygen into the failing US strategy of intervention and economic blockade against the people of Venezuela," the ministry said.
"Bukele is officially assuming the sad role of a pawn of US foreign policy."
