VERONA, Wis. - Halloween costumes got some last minute additions as parents bundled their kids for the cold and snow.
Emily Grahm stopped at Blain’s Farm and Fleet to pick up gloves for her young Michael Jackson and Hermione Granger.
“I just feel sorry for them,” Grahm said about covering their costumes. “But they’ll be OK. We’ll bundle them, and they’ll stay warm hopefully.”
