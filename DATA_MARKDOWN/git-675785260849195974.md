BAFANA BLUE is fancied to win for the fourth time during a fruitful 2019 by beating six rivals for the Cumberland Handicap Chase (3.40) at Carlisle this afternoon. The Maurice Barnes-trained eight-year-old was having his first outing of the winter when scoring over course and distance 10 days ago and Ross Chapmanâ€™s mount should once again be competitive despite a 5lb rise in the weights.
