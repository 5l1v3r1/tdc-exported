MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - The Environmental Protection Agency has released the first of two plans intended to transfer oversight of Superfund units to Montana.
Montana Public Radio reported the Institutional Control Implementation and Assurance Plan outlines how the state should mitigate the spread of remaining contamination in Libby and Troy.
The areas account for two of eight units in the Libby Asbestos Superfund Site.
The EPA has removed asbestos and vermiculite from more than 2,600 private and industrial properties in Libby and Troy since 1999.
The plan aimed at preventing further contamination spread precedes the EPA giving site control to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality.
The proposal outlines the responsibilities of state and county officials working with property owners and calls for local ordinances requiring owners to report contaminants.
