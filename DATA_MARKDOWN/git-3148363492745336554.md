Colorado State University (CSU) student senator Koby Peters was removed from a student government meeting which took place on the day before Halloween, because he wore a costume depicting Justin Trudeau in “blackface,” according to a report by the Collegian.
The motion to remove the student senator passed overwhelmingly with a vote of 29-1-2. Peters, who is black, said that he arrived at the meeting wearing the blackface Justin Trudeau costume in order to start a conversation.
“I was truly hoping, I guess you could say, to open up a dialogue,” said Peters of his costume.
