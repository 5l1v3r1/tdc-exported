Mercedes-Benz Australia has issued a recall for the 2015-16 model-year GT S supercar over concerns of a potential transmission failure.
"The adhesive connection of the drive shaft to the engine/transmission flange may not meet specifications," the company reports.
"This may lead to the development of unusual noise, transmission malfunctions or, in certain cases, to loss of connection between the engine and transmission."
Mercedes-Benz says transmission malfunctions or a loss of connection between the engine and transmission creates an increased risk of accident and/or injury to occupants of the vehicle and other road users.
A total of 92 vehicles are included in this recall, available for sale from 3 August 2015 through 30 September 2016 â€“ the VIN list is available here.
Owners of the affected AMG GT S models are requested to contact their preferred Mercedes-Benz dealer to arrange the inspection and repair of their vehicle, to be carried out free of charge.
