Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, whose supporters are encamped in Islamabad in an anti-government protest dubbed as ‘Azadi March’, has warned of chaos if the demands he has put forth are not met.
In an interview to Dawn News on Thursday, the JUI-F chief said their protest will not end until the “incompetent” government resigned; stressing that fresh elections in the country was the only solution to the present crisis.
“There will be chaos in the country… can’t say what might happen [in the days to come],” he told the interviewer. “We will not attack… [rather] will embrace martyrdom,” he added. “We are ready to sacrifice our lives…we will not leave…who do you think we are?”
