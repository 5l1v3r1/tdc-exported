It's a pocket of Plymouth you won't know a huge amount about unless you happen to live there or know someone who does.
Ernesettle's another one of those post-war housing estates in Plymouth that's had quite the journey.
And it's got a cracking story to tell - you may have read only recently that it was practically built from the ground up by German prisoners.
There's plenty of faces and names that have made life down there a memorable one.
And thankfully we've got access to a massive archive that allows us to celebrate all those local characters.
Click on the gallery below and enjoy looking back on Ernesettle's golden moments.
