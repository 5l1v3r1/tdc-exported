Sam Smith has unveiled their cover of Donna Summer’s seminal disco hit ‘I Feel Love’. Listen to it in full below.
Smith’s cover offers a modern spin on Summer’s 1977 classic hit and will be featured in the Christmas campaign for US retail store Target.
“As a queer person ‘I Feel Love’ has followed me to every dance floor in every queer space from the minute I started clubbing,” Smith wrote on Twitter.
“This song to me is an anthem of our community and it was an honour and most importantly so much fun to have a go at it. Highest song I’ve ever fucking sang. But a joy. I hope you all like it.”
