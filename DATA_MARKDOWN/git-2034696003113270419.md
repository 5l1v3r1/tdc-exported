        "We invite them to offer their apologies to Scott's family and friends for what they have endured"
      
Radiohead have posted a new statement to the band’s Twitter account concerning the collapse of a temporary stage at Downsview Park Toronto in 2012, which led to the death of the band’s drum technician Scott Johnson, asking that those “responsible” for the incident apologise to Johnson’s family and friends.
In the statement posted this afternoon (November 5), the band said that “we all acknowledge that no one intended for Scott to die,” but notes that “only Optex staging company owner Dale Martin has taken any ownership of his role in the tragedy”. Read the full statement below.
