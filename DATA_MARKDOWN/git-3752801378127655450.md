South Africa exploded in a celebration of tears, cheers and dancing as the Springboks dominated their English rivals to win the finals of the Rugby World Cup in Japan on Saturday. 
Ahead of the hotly contested final, fans, schools and even President Cyril Ramaphosa met with Boks rallied behind the national team to give them messages of support.
The Boks went into the match as slight underdogs, but they were superb from start to finish as they dominated almost every department against an English outfit that could not repeat its heroic semi-final performance against the All Blacks.
