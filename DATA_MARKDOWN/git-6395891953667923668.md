BOSTON - Hundreds of convenience stores plan to close all day Wednesday while store owners rally to oppose a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and to "demonstrate the critical role they play providing vital resources to communities," organizers said.
Members of the Boston Convenience Store Owners Association and other independent stores across the state -- about 1,000 of them in total, according to organizers -- on Monday will post notices informing customers of the closures and explaining "the risks associated with such a ban including the failure of proposed bans to prevent minors from accessing and using tobacco, racial inequality, food security, and crime."
