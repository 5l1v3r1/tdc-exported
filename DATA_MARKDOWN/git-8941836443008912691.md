ST. LOUIS (AP) - Authorities have released the names of two people shot and killed in a northern St. Louis apartment this weekend.
St. Louis County police told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that 48-year-old Artelia Harold and 51-year-old Bennie Whalen both died Saturday after being shot in their Riverview apartment during a domestic dispute. Harold and Whalen were a couple.
Authorities say it appears that Whalen shot Harold before another adult in the home shot Whalen. That third person called 911 and has been cooperating with police.
