FUZHOU (China): The Indian men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty continued with their good run as they entered the quarterfinals of the ongoing China Open tournament on Thursday.
In an intense second-round clash that lasted for 65 minutes, the Indian duo held on their nerves to defeat the Japanese pair of Hiroyuki Endo-Yuta Watanabe 21-18, 21-23, 21-11 at the Haixia Olympics Sports Center.
This is the second straight win for the Indian duo over Endo-Watanabe after they had defeated the pair from Japan in straight games at the French Open last month.
They will now face Li Jun Hui and Liu Yu Chen of China on Friday for a place in the semi-finals. The young Indian pair has been on the rise this year and has been raking up wins consistently against the top seeds in the world.
They had reached the French Open final last month, where they lost to World No.1 Marcus Fernaldi Gideon-Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo. Before that, they had clinched their maiden Super 500 title at the Thailand Open in August.
