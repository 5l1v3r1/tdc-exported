When choosing a place to spend our vacation, we freeze when we see amazing photos of beaches and sights in capitals that we find when reading the ads and guidebooks. And, unfortunately, sometimes it happens that when we finally arrive at our destination, the place doesn’t even look close to how we expected it to be. A beautiful view might be spoiled by an angle that is different from the ad photos and a huge crowd of tourists, or some unusual natural phenomenon.
We at Bright Side are asking you not to panic and not to get upset when something like this happens. Just enjoy the new views, because you went on vacation to experience new and positive emotions. And this article will show you what you should be ready for.
Do you have photos from your trips where your expectations were really different from reality?
