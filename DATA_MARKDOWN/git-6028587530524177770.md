Topline: AT&T agreed to pay $60 million to settle litigation from the Federal Trade Commission alleging that the company lied about the terms of its unlimited data plan by slowing down speeds after customers surpassed an arbitrary data cap. 
Crucial quote: “AT&T promised unlimited data—without qualification—and failed to deliver on that promise,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “While it seems obvious, it bears repeating that Internet providers must tell people about any restrictions on the speed or amount of data promised.”
Key background: While the FTC’s rollback of net neutrality rules has prompted concerns that companies like AT&T could throttle speeds, what the FTC accused AT&T of didn’t technically violate the principles of net neutrality. If AT&T had throttled data for particular apps or websites, that would have run afoul of net neutrality. 
Tangent: AT&T’s management has been inundated with criticism over the past month from activist hedge fund Elliot Management. The fund, which has a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T, accused the company of having a jumbled management structure and for making a mistake in acquiring of DirecTV. In response to the fund’s demands around cost cutting and restructuring, AT&T said last week it would add new board members and divest up to $10 billion of assets in 2020 in order to reduce its large debt pile.
