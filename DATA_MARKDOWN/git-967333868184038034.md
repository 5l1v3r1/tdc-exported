        The protests began in early September because of fuel shortages, with the opposition movement gaining momentum since Haitian President Jovenel Moise emerged victorious from the 2017 presidential election, which had allegedly been marred by fraud.
      
The UN's human rights body stated Friday that at least 42 people have been killed and some 86 people injured in Haiti since mid-September whenÂ anti-government protests started to unfold.
