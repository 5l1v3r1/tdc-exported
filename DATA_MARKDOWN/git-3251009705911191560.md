Most Indian cars sold in the market are not as safe according to the international standards. While all the cars meet the regulations laid out by the Indian government when it comes to safety. Global NCAP or Global New Car Assessment Program is a charity program that works towards making cars safer around the globe. The organisation tests vehicles around the world and give them star ratings after getting crash-tested in a controlled environment. The Global NCAP has tested around 25 Indian cars till date and here are all the cars that have scored at least 4 stars in the test.
