The slain suspects were identified as Mark Panganoron, a man included in the unified drug watch list of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police and Mark Anthony Mallares.
According to San Jose del Monte City Police Station commander, Lieutenant Colonel Orlando Castil Jr., the two have just conspired to sell shabu to an undercover officer in LotÂ  46, Block 2, Towerville 6F, Barangay Gaya-gaya around 1:15 p.m. Monday when they sensed the ongoing buy-bust operation and engaged the lawmen in a firefight which resulted to their death.
