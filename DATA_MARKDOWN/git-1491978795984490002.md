Antonio Brown, the star wide receiver currently the subject of an NFL investigation into alleged sexual assaults, has mounted another social media attack on the league.
ESPN had reported Brown was due to meet with the league over the allegations next week but on Thursday the 31-year-old lashed out on Twitter. “Imagine conforming to a system giving it a 100 percent to see them treat me like this is unfairly ! Making money off my sweat and blood Fuck the @nfl I’ll never play in that shit treat black people the worse! Clear my name and go fuck your self,” he wrote.
