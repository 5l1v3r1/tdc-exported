Discovery Channel has announced a new competition show which pits humans against grizzly bears in tests of “strength, speed and stamina”, which is due to premiere on 4 December. The human competitors reportedly include both men and women.
The “Man vs Bear” series will include “challenges inspired by what bears do naturally in the wild”, the channel said, referring to rolling massive logs, tree-climbing, eating competitions and a “monumental game of tug of war”.
