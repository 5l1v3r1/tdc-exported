ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi visited Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) hospital on Saturday for a brief medical check-up after he complained about experiencing hernia pain.
Earlier this week, the medical board recommended a hernia surgery for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader, but the former premier was not ready to be operated at PIMS.
During his medical examination, the doctors performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine his condition.
After the medical examination, the former premier left the hospital.
A medical board on Monday suggested shifting the former prime minister, who is currently incarcerated in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) scandal, from Adalia jail to a hospital after his health deteriorated.
During Abbasi’s appearance before the accountability court on Monday, the political leader’s counsel submitted a plea praying upon the court to broadcast the LNG scandal trial on television.
The former premier also moved a petition in the accountability court seeking permission to be treated at Al-Shifa Hospital on his expense.
