Premier League top-scorer Jamie Vardy is benefiting from “little adjustments” according to Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers.
The former England striker netted his 10th goal of the Premier League season during Sunday’s 2-0 win away to Crystal Palace.
It sent Leicester back up to third with Vardy, 32, leading the way for goals in the top flight after 11 games.
