KARACHI: The Awami Workers Party’s website, temporarily blocked in the lead-up to the 2018 general elections, was restored after the party lodged objections with the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Islamabad High Court.
Among other practices, it is such ad hoc content restrictions that have resulted in Pakistan being among countries “where governments are increasingly using social media to manipulate elections and monitor their citizens”, a human rights watchdog said Tuesday.
