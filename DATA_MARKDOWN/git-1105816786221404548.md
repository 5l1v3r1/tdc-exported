If you could solve one problem in your country, what would it be was a question asked at the beginning of #techwomen19 as emerging leaders gathered to present their action plan and the process of strategising the solution to that one problem.
Team Pakistan not only presented but was also listed amongst the top five pitches. Their initiative was Bacha-o which reflected the problem of child sexual abuse using a digital platform. Their mission is to make every child safe which has been on a rise as per the recent report by the Pakistani government.
