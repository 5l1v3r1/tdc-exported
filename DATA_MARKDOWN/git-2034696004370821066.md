        Cannot wait.
      
Christopher Nolan has debuted the cryptic new trailer for Tenet, his forthcoming eleventh project.
In the first clip from the British director’s latest movie, we see BlacKkKlansman star John David Washington surveying a series of bullet-holes littered across a reinforced pane of glass.
The action then cuts to footage of a riot squad heading into action, alongside what appears to be a particularly brutal interrogation.
In true Nolan style, the mystery intensifies right at the end as Washington’s character is seen wearing an oxygen mask, before the screen fades to white.
Although the project remains shrouded in secrecy, an official IMDB listing describes the film as “an action epic revolving around international espionage, time travel, and evolution.”
