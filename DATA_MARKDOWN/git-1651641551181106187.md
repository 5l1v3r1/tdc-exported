Google Maps and Waze aren’t the only two navigation apps that the firm has in reserve. The firm launched a Google Pigeon app, a crowdsourced navigation app for local transit users, in New York last year. Now, Google has extended support for the app to five further cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington DC.
Much like Waze, this app relies on having users log in delays and cancellations, so transit users can make informed decisions intelligently. Unlike the Waze app, this app is for those relying on public transit for their commute, rather than drivers.
Google has brought this app to iOS, but if you have an Android phone you can apply to be on the waiting list and get the app sooner rather than later.
