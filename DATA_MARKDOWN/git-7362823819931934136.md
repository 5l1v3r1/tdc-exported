Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is facing deepening skepticism, including from some in her own party, over her "Medicare-for-all" plan -- as she not only claims the middle class won’t be hit with a tax hike but even suggests billionaires alone can fund it.
As Fox News first reported, Warren on Friday outlined a plan costing $52 trillion over the next decade, including $20 trillion in new spending -- covered largely by an array of taxes on corporations, the wealthy and employers in general. While insisting the middle class would be spared, Warren, D-Mass., went a step further in Dubuque, Iowa, over the weekend when pressed by reporters.

“It doesn’t raise taxes on anybody but billionaires,” Warren said. “And you know what, the billionaires can afford it, and I don’t call them middle class.”
When pressed again whether anyone with under $1 billion net worth would feel a tax hike, she said: “That’s right—not paying a penny more.”
“Understand this. This is no increase in taxes for anyone except billionaires,” she said. “Period. Done.”
