MADISON, Wis. - A Madison substitute teacher is on leave as the school investigates a "serious incident" involving the use of a racial slur, an official said. 
Hamilton Middle School Principal John Burkholder said in a letter to students' families Thursday that the teacher used a racial slur while a student was present, and that the district is investigating. 
The teacher was put on leave, according to the letter. 
Madison Teachers Inc. Executive Director Doug Keillor told News 3 Now the union doesn't comment on incidents that are still under investigation by the district. 
"While I cannot get into details, I want to emphasize that racial slurs have no place in our school," Burkholder wrote. 
The school said its top priority has been to support the student involved and take the appropriate next steps, "and that is where our focus has been."
