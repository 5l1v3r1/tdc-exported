A teenager is to appear in court after a customer was allegedly attacked at a bar in Kings Heath.
An assault was said to have happened at the Hop & Scotch Bar on Institute Road, just off High Street, on Monday evening, November 4.
A West Midlands Police spokesman said "A 15-year-old boy has been charged with two counts of assault, theft from a shop and criminal damage. He was remanded to appear before Birmingham Magistrates Court today (6 November)."
The owners of Hop & Scotch took to social media to express their anger.
