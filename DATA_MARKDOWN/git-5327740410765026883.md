Surrey Hospice Society held its annual Dove Release Memorial Service Sunday morning.
Held at Bear Creek Park from 9-11 a.m., the event, described by the society, can provide a healing experience for individuals and families moving through their grieving process.
Prior to the release, hospice executive director Rebecca Smith read poems and invited participants to light a candle for their loved one.

“Letting go is not the same as forgetting,” Smith said, following a performance from a quartet from University of British Columbia and Holy Cross Regional High School.
After the music and presentations, participants followed Smith outside and released five white doves.
