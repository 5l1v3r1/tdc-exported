More than 450 inmates in Oklahoma were released Monday, a representative from the Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt's office told CBS News, the largest single-day commutation in U.S. history. Video and photos from outside the state's prisons show former inmates tearfully reuniting with their loved ones upon release.
"We are so grateful to see this day come," Sue Ann Arnall, a board member of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform, said in a Monday press release. "We've been working for several years to reduce the prison population and improve public safety. Now these men and women will return to their families, get their lives back together and contribute to the greater good."
The commutations came after a 2019 law made it easier to review the sentences of inmates who were previously charged with crimes that would not be considered felonies if charged today, the governor's office said in a news release. That includes simple drug possession, which is now considered a misdemeanor, and some low-level property crimes.
