        "It has always felt like the perfect place for these two special shows"
      
Coldplay have announced that they are launching ‘Everyday Life’ with two performances in Jordan, where they’ll play the record in full.
Last month, the band confirmed that they’ll release the double album on November 22 – split into two halves called ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Sunset’ respectively.
It was accompanied by the release of ‘Orphans’ and ‘Arabesque‘, the first two tracks to arrive from the album.
