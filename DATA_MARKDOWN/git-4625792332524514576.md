President Trump insulted the Washington Post journalists who published a story alleging the president wanted Attorney General William Barr to hold a press conference declaring him innocent of any wrongdoing in regards to the impeachment proceedings.
The president addressed the story, which claims that Trump has expressed his belief that Barr should've held the press conference to associates in recent weeks, in multiple tweets on Thursday morning, first going after them for basing their story on anonymous sources.
"Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an 'anonymous' source that doesn’t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!" the president tweeted. "The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference," he said. "Never happened, and there were no sources!"
