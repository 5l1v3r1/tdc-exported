Ethereum’s price has been slowly grinding lower over the past 24-hours which comes about as the asset sees an even further decline in its on-chain volume, and ETH is now at risk of breaking below a key short term support level, which could mean that a period of capitulation is imminent.
In spite of this, one prominent analyst is noting that he believes that any potential price dip for both Ethereum and Bitcoin in the near-term could simply be a bear trap that provides traders and investors alike with an ideal long-entry.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 2% at its current price of $182, which marks a notable drop from its 24-hour highs of $186 that were set yesterday.
Ethereum’s downwards movement today comes concurrently with a similar movement by Bitcoin, which hit highs of $9,400 overnight before it began a short-term downtrend that has sent it to beneath $9,200.
This bearishness today is simply an extension of the period of choppy trading that has been experienced by the aggregated crypto markets over the past several days and weeks, and Ethereum is currently caught in a trading range between $180 and $192, with the former price being a key support level that has held strong on multiple occasions over the past several weeks.
ETH has also been facing declining trading volume over the past week, which has dropped even further today, with TokenAnalyst noting that it has plummeted by nearly 34% over the past 24-hours.
