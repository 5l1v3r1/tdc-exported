Mexican and American film actress and producer Salma Hayek posted a photo of herself on social media as she was leaving to attend the 2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala Honoring Betye Saar and Alfonso Cuarón Presented by Gucci in Los Angeles on Saturday.
The caption she added read: “On my way to the @Gucci Gala 💕 En mi camino a la #Gucci Gala”.
Hayek, 53, made a bold statement in a sequined figure-hugging gown made of glittering pink material that oozed glamour.
The dress the Oscar-nominated star wore had a halter neck and minimal black trimming at the seams that matched a small leather clutch in her hand.
The gorgeous 5-foot-2 actress stood tall in a pair of towering platform heels, and accessorised with glistening diamond drop earrings and an ornate diamond bracelet.
