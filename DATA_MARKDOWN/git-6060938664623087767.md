Man of the moment Kartik Aaryan had his dream come true when he turned cover-boy for his first ever Filmfare magazine shoot. In an official launch event, the star unveiled the cover of the magazine that saw him rocking his trademark messy bed-head look in high-fashion nightwear.
Today, a new set of photos of the star from his drool-worthy shoot have been posted online. From rocking a three-piece suit to stripping down to put his abs on full display, these new set of photos will have you swooning over the hunk.
Kartik has been making his way to the top, one successful film at a time. All thanks to his impressive acting talents and ruggedly good looks, the hunk has managed to woo the ladies over in under a decade in the film industry.
With films like ‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’ with Ananya Panday, ‘Aaj Kal’ with Sara Ali Khan and ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2’with Kiara Advani, fans can be assured that their favourite star will be hitting the big screen at regular intervals all through the year.
