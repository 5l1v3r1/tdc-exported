It’s November, which means we’re about to be bombarded with awards season contenders, and this year, we’ve got an embarrassment of riches on the release calendar. We’ve got a Mr. Rogers biopic starring Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood), a sequel to a wildly popular Disney film (Frozen II), a historical drama starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones (The Aeronauts), a crime thriller written by Lena Waithe with Daniel Kaluuya (Queen & Slim), an acclaimed festival darling written by and starring Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy), just to name a few. And guess what? Not a single one of those made it into our top five most anticipated movies of November. Read on to see what Rotten Tomatoes users and our fans on social media are looking forward to this month.
