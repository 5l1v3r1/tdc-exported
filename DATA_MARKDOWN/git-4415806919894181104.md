Rory McIlroy edged out Xander Schauffele in a play-off to win the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.
The world number two won at the first extra hole at the Sheshan International Golf Club after the pair both finished on 19 under.
Schauffele, the defending champion, had birdied the 18th to take the event into a play-off but he could only score par as the pair played it again in sudden death.
