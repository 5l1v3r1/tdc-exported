        Sebastian Vettel missed out on pole position by just 0.012. The damage was done in the opening lap of the Q3 session with Valtteri Bottas producing a strong lap to open the session. Vettel improved but not enough to continue Mercedes' pole position drought. 
      
The Ferrari driver, who will start from P2, is keen to attack Bottas on the first corner of the race. With the Ferrari strategy similar to their German rivals, Vettel knows his best chance will be on the first lap. 
"Overall happy. Let's see for tomorrow and have a good start.and then a good race. All of us are on the medium tyre so nobody had an advantage there. The first lap for sure is important but it's a long race after that," Vettel said after the qualifying session.
