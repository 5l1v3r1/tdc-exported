Rosie O’Donnell and fiancée Elizabeth Rooney have reportedly broken up after two years together.
According to RadarOnline, O’Donnell, 57, hasn’t mentioned Rooney, 34, “in a while,” and scrubbed the Boston police officer from her Instagram.
Rooney also deleted O’Donnell from her social media, including a photo from Oct. 2018 showing off her engagement ring.

“I am in love,” she told Stern. “It’s the first time I’ve dated someone younger than me and it’s a very trippy thing.”
Despite claiming at the time she would never get married for a third time, O’Donnell confirmed the couple’s engagement in 2018.
O’Donnell was married to Kelli Carpenter from 2004 to 2007 and Michelle Rounds, who died by apparent suicide in 2017, from 2012 to 2015.
