        Sebastian Gorka is a big 'Radioactive' fan, it seems
      
US President Donald Trump‘s former Deputy Assistant has been banned from YouTube – all thanks to Imagine Dragons.
Sebastian Gorka, a conservative commentator who briefly worked for the POTUS back in 2017, uploaded his America First radio shows to the video streaming platform shortly after their initial broadcast.
Over the summer, Imagine Dragons’ frontman Dan Reynolds was made aware that Gorka featured the band’s 2012 hit, ‘Radioactive’, on a regular basis. The musician responded by claiming that he’d “never given permission” for use of the track in the show.
“Please stop playing Imagine Dragons on your show @SebGorka,” he tweeted. See that post below.
