Manchester United have chartered a flight to Kasakhstan for their Europa League tie against Astana for around 100 fans who lost their bookings when Thomas Cook collapsed.
Thomas Cook Sports, who were travel partners with United, had pre-sold travel packages to fans for the away leg of United's tie against Astana.
United have confirmed that fans who can provide proof of booking with Thomas Cook will be awarded free return flights to the November 28 tie, a 6,000-mile round trip.
A United spokesman said: "We have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters.
"We are pleased to be able to confirm that Manchester United will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.
"Beyond the Astana fixture, we are investigating longer term options around facilitating European travel for our loyal fans."
The UK Civil Aviation Authority confirmed travel firm Thomas Cook had "ceased trading with immediate effect" on September 23.
Thomas Cook's chief executive Peter Fankhauser said the collapse was a "matter of profound regret", and apologised to the "millions of customers, and thousands of employees".
