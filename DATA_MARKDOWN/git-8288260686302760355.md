Medics transferred a woman to hospital after a car flipped onto its side during a dramatic smash in Kingswinford.
The motorist – who has not been named – was treated for her injuries before being taken to Russells Hall Hospital after the crash in Lawnswood Road at around 12.30pm on Friday, November 1.
Her injuries are not thought to be serious, a spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service.
 
The road was closed for a short while as emergency crews worked at the scene and treated the injured.
Eyewitnesses told Black Country Live that the car was heavily damaged and two off-duty nurses helped before ambulance staff arrived.
