It's important for kids to learn that the world is replete with charlatans, mountebanks, rascals, rogues, hustlers, flim-flammers, tricksters, and con artists.
Disney is doing its part by selling a kit of "1001 Stickers" of famous Disney princesses like Ariel, Jasmine, etc. But when kids open the package, they'll see that 768 of the stickers are, as one disappointed Reddit user put it, "useless fucking squares. Thanks Disney."
Thanks, indeed! It's a cheap way to learn a valuable lesson.
