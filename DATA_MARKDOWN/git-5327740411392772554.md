An air quality bulletin for Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley has been cancelled.
In a news release Wednesday afternoon, Metro Vancouver said the fine particulate matter advisory is over. It had initially been issued on Friday.
“Air quality has improved due to changes in the weather that have increased dispersion of air contaminants from emissions sources in the region,” the news release stated.
