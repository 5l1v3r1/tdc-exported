BANGKOK, Nov 2 — Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad today met with his Thai counterpart, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, on the sidelines of the 35th Asean Summit and Related Summit here. 
It is learnt that in the 45-minute meeting held at the IMPACT Convention and Exhibition Centre, both leaders discussed various issues of mutual interests, including the need to strengthen the bilateral economic partnership.
