        It happened while the Commander in Chief was sat ringside at UFC 244
      
Donald Trump stopped by New York’s Madison Square Garden last night for UFC 244 and was met with boos and people yelling the lyrics to YG‘s ‘FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)’ at him.
Not seeming to care all that much about the cold reception, the president waved back at his detractors as he sat ringside for the event that saw Jorge Masvidal defeat Nate Diaz in the main event.
Aside from being booed, POTUS and his presidential entourage, which included several Secret Service agents, were subject to some people yelling the chorus to YG and Nipsey Hussle‘s anti-Trump anthem.
Take a look at some clips from the event below:
