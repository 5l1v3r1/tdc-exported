Square Enix appear to be gathering staff to embark on an all-new action IP for "HD consoles," with an ambitious job advert that seems to herald the project as something very unique indeed.According to the advert on the Square Enix Japan Recruitment website, the First Development Division - responsible for titles such as Kingdom Hearts III, Romancing SaGa III Remaster, and the highly-anticipated Final Fantasy VII Remake - are looking for team members to join them in the development of the new title.The ad says that Square Enix aims to "realize a ‘next-generation action game experience’ that goes beyond the framework of existing action games, with an international team of creators from all over the world." Of course, this tells us nothing, but given the pedigree of franchise this division deals in, it seems snug that the mysterious new game will be a major player in Square Enix's next-gen release plans.Square Enix developing unannounced new IP for HD consoles [Game Talk / Gematsu]
