        New Delhi (Sputnik): A minor row over parking of vehicles on court premises in New Delhi between police personnel and lawyers has blown out into a major row, with lawyers in several locations across India continuing to resort to violence targeting policemen and litigants.
      
A large number of police personnel have come out of the headquarters of Delhi Police Station in New Delhi demanding action against lawyers involved in an attack on police on Saturday at the Tis Hazari District Court in the national capital.
Lawyers continued violent protests on Monday in New Delhi and several other places in the country, attacking policemen, litigants and ordinary people.
Holding placards saying “We want Justice”, “How is the Josh….? Low Sir…!” police personnel in uniform and civil attire wore black arm-bands to condemn the attacks on their colleagues.
Several officers of the elite Indian Police Service (IPS) took to Twitter to express their anguish.
Deependra Pathak, Director General of Andaman and Nicobar Islands in a tweet said, “Lumpen elements in the garb of Black Coat are on a total rampage endangering social orderliness in Delhi”.
