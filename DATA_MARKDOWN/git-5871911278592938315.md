The he said/she said stuff with the Celtics borders on the ridiculous. Last month we learned that Kyrie Irving reportedly told the Celtics he was leaving town during his exit interview, a direct contradiction of what Danny Ainge told us all in June.
Now we’re hearing about another tale of contradictory recollections, this time with Marcus Morris:
BSJ’s Brian Robb estimates the Celtics extension offer was likely 3 years and $34 million, but doubling-up Morris’ $5.3 million salary was not enough to keep him around.
It’s a damn shame because Morris would be a tremendous presence on Boston’s second unit. Morris will likely surpass the $34 million Boston offered (he’s making $15 million this year), but there’s no guarantee he’ll be doing it for a playoff team.
