BHUBANESWAR: A 5-1 win for India women, a 4-2 scrape through win for the men. The first round of Olympic hockey qualifiers here on Friday put all predictions to shame. But while it left the Indian eves breathing easy, the men must have woken up anxious on Saturday, with a Russian roulette awaiting them at the Kalinga Stadium.
Rising to the occasion and living up to their growing reputation, Rani Rampal & Co scripted an American heist that will be talked about for years to come.
The win, with a four-goal advantage, has almost decisively tilted the scales in favour of India, who moved with authority and then bossed the game to leave the American girls gasping.
