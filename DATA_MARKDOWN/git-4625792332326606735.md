Billionaire Mark Cuban said he would vote for any politician who puts forth legislation that cracks down on news networks presenting opinion as news.
"Any politician that says they will push for a law that says no tv or streaming network can brand,market or name themselves a News Network unless the 6 most viewed hours of every night is >80% fact checked news and opinion is clearly labeled as opinion only, gets my vote," the owner of the Dallas Mavericks tweeted Sunday, adding that, in his opinion, "It would reduce the partisanship in this country almost overnight."
