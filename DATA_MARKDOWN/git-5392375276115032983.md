Its peak sales season where there is a huge rush for multiple products. Frequent online buyers know that the “return policy” of any online store is very important. Amazon launches its annual return deadlines considering the critical sales period. From November 1, 2019, all purchases made in the period up to December 31, 2019, will benefit from the campaign. For customers, the return period for these purchases extends until January 31, 2020.
Amazon’s new return policy covers the periods in which the sales for all categories will be very high. This extended return period will be beneficial for those who hope to take advantage of the classic Cyber ​​Monday, as well as the Christmas business deals. Do you think this policy will make buyers more comfortable?
