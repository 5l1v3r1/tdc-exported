        American millionaire and reality TV star Kim Kardashian has long been an advocate for US criminal justice reform, visiting the White House this summer and previously also lobbying for the pardon of several convicted individuals, including Alice Marie Johnson.
      
In a recent interview with The New York Times, Kim Kardashian opened up about her attitude towards Donald Trump by praising the job he’s done in relation to prison reform, while also revealing that on some political issues, such as immigration, she and the US president do not always see eye to eye.  
“I’m very focused, there’s a lot that we have to get done in prison reform and I believe I will be more beneficial if I just focus on that at the moment. So I’m grateful for that relationship in that area and I focus on that”, she added.
