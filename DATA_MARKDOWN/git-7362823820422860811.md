Pink opened up about her experience shooting her first-ever music video, and it may not be what you expected.
Pink's first single, "There You Go," debuted in 2000, and the video featuref her riding a motorcycle.
"My first video. I think this is the prettiest I've ever looked and will ever look," the 40-year-old singer told Billboard. "I think I was 19 when I shot this video. I'd just started riding motorcycles. I almost crashed 85 times."

That wasn't the only trouble that Pink got herself into during the shoot.
"I smoked a lot of weed, too, and [director] Dave Meyers kept coming up to me and saying, 'Can you wait to smoke that next blunt before the beauty shot?'" she continued. "I was like, 'What do you mean?' He was like, 'I really want you to be able to open your eyes.' I was like, 'My eyes are open.'"
She also spoke about her famously acrobatic 2010 Grammy performance, in which she performed "Glitter in the Air."
