Brig. Gen. Leonardo Cesneros, officer-in-charge of the Police Regional Office 3 here, identified the suspect as Ralph John Aaron Marcos “alias Arjay,”  of Loma de Gato in Marilao.
Marcos is the suspect in the killing of Hsuan Hsueh alias “Peter Lee,” 68, inside the IGC Industrial warehouse compound in Loma de Gato, Marilao last October 29.
Police conducted a review of the closed circuit television footage in the premises and based on the accounts of the witnesses,  Marcos entered the warehouse  around 1 a.m. and stabbed the victim dead.
The knife used by the suspect was recovered by the Bulacan Crime Laboratory Office at the crime scene while the suspect’s pants with blood stains was later recovered at his residence in Venturanza Compound, Bgy. Loma de Gato, Marilao, Bulacan.
Consequently, while Marilao police were conducting investigation, Marcos was  accompanied by his parents and voluntarily surrendered himself to Marilao town Mayor Ricky Sylvestre.
“Time and again, we encourage the public to report any information or knowledge regarding crimes committed. We are appealing to everyone to help us and be our eyes and ears in the community against lawlessness. By working together, we will be able to accomplish more,” Cesneros said.
