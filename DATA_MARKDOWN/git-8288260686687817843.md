A 37-year-old man has denied attempting to murder a police officer who suffered a fractured skull when he was hit by a car which failed to stop.
Tekle Lennox also denied a charge alleging that he caused grievous bodily harm to Police Constable Chris Burnham with intent to resist arrest in the Radford area of Coventry.
Lennox, of no fixed address, will face trial on March 2 next year after being remanded in custody on Monday following a brief hearing at Warwick Crown Court in Leamington Spa.
The defendant, who admitted a charge of driving while disqualified, appeared in court via a prison videolink.
The attempted murder and grievous bodily harm charges relate to an incident in which Pc Burnham was struck by a vehicle on September 25 this year.
The 48-year-old officer was left in a critical condition after suffering head injuries and a shattered knee.
In a statement issued after he was released from hospital last month, Pc Burnham expressed thanks to the public and NHS staff for their support, including numerous messages of goodwill.
