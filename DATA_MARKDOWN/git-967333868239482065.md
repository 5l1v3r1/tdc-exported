        In December 2018, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) launched an official inquiry into the Institute for Statecraft, the parent organisation of shadowy and controversial UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office programme Integrity Initiative.
      
A month earlier, international hacking syndicate Anonymous released a batch of internal files it'd appropriated from the Institute’s servers. The material was explosive and troubling in the absolute extreme, revealing the ‘charity’ - which had received millions in funding from the British state and NATO, among others - to be an international information warfare effort run by military intelligence specialists, which had disrupted the domestic politics of several countries and smeared progressive politicians at home.
Almost immediately, concerned members of the public – myself among them – began filing complaints about the Institute and Initiative to the OSCR. My first was prompted after learning the organisation fraudulently listed a crumbling, derelict building in a remote part of Fife, Scotland as its principal office address, when in reality it’d never operated there.
