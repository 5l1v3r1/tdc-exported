BHUBANESWAR: Coach Sjoerd Marijne was on the pitch before the Indian players arrived for warm-up. The confidence in his stride was evident as he recced the turf for all the warm-up paraphernalia in place. An hour later, and after at least a kilometre of pacing in the Indian dugout, he was breathing a lot easier. It was a hand-on-mouth scoreline staring USA in the face at the end of 60 minutes. India had won 5-1, only their fifth win over USA, and one that has almost shattered America's Tokyo dreams.
India would have taken a win with any scoreline, but 5-1 in the first game of a two-match Olympic qualifier is like arriving at Tokyo's check-in counter.
"No, absolutely not," Marijne swatted any such thoughts. "You know how the process can go. You don't get a ticket to tokyo today. You can get it tomorrow. You have nothing so far."
The hosts played two matches in 60 minutes. First one in the opening 15 minutes and the next in the last 45, when the crowd in Kalinga Stadium stands swelled to almost 10,000. The best part was India's confidence grew with it.
