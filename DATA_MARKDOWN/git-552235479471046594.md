First Minister Nicola Sturgeon intends to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence next year.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said if the SNP 'win' at the upcoming general election on December 12, her party's demands for another vote will become 'irresistible'.
Sturgeon said: "It is my intention to have a referendum next year.
"On this question of will Westminster allow it or not, we are the start of an election campaign - this is an opportunity for the people in Scotland to have their say and make their views known.
"If the SNP win this election, I think that demand becomes irresistible.
Â 
"This idea that for self-interest reasons Westminster politicians can stand in the way of people in Scotland choosing their own future, we already see that start to crumble."
Sturgeon said Labour were already "pretty much conceding" it could not stand in the way of a second independence vote and added: "I suspect it won't be too much longer until we see the Tories struggle to maintain that argument as well."
A spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn told the Daily Record last month that "Labour would not support a bid for second referendum in the formative years of a Labour government."
