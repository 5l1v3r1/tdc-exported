The facelifted BMW 5 Series Touring has been spied again, this time with less disguise, especially around the front of the vehicle.
Up front, there's a revised bumper with triangular vents towards the edges. There's also a new grille design with the double kidney elements fused together.
Mercifully the 5 Series looks to have escaped, at least for now, the tall and narrow kidney grilles first seen on the Concept 4 coupe and leaked pre-production versions of the new 4 Series coupe.
The revised grille also seems to have missed out on the steroids given to the 7 Series facelift, or the latest X5 and X7 crossovers.
Head- and tail-light graphics have been changed, while the rear bumper has been tweaked slightly and now incorporates more aggressively-styled exhaust tips.
Under the skin we can expect the revised 5 Series to have some tweaked powertrains.
One possible addition to the range is the 290kW/600Nm six-cylinder plug-in hybrid setup from the 745e xDrive.
