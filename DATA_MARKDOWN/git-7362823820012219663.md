Frustrated New York Jets’ fans were attacked on Instagram over the weekend by cornerback Darryl Roberts after a devastating loss to the winless Miami Dolphins — but head coach Adam Gase said Monday the team doesn’t plan to cut Roberts.
Roberts posted a profanity-laced rant to his Instagram Stories Sunday calling out the “fake a-- fans” after the Jets lost 26-18 to the Dolphins (1-7).

“I’m sorry but it gotta be said!” the post read. “All y’all fake a-- fans f---in kill me wit dat negative s---, if u gon rock wit us then rock wit us but if u ain’t shut tf up please & go like another team!”
He continued: “And another thing y’all need to stop @’n players talkin crazy becaus y’all known dam well you wouldn’t buss a dam grape in a fruit fight! Ok i’m done have a nice day!”
The message was not received well by fans, with many calling for Roberts to be cut.
After being called out by a local New Jersey reporter, Roberts said he loved “the loyal fans,” adding, “stop putting words in my mouth.”
