        Irish U21 international Troy Parrott has been named on the Tottenham bench for the first time in the Premier League ahead of Spursâ€™ clash with Everton this afternoon.
      
The 17-year-old has never made a squad in the top flight for Spurs but is included among the substitutes for the game at Goodison Park.
Tottenham captain Harry Kane did not travel with the squad for the game against Everton, who have also struggled at the start of the season, meaning Parrott makes the bench while Lucas Moura comes into the side.
