Ramsey scored his first Champions League goal for Juve during the club's 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow when he poked home Ronaldo's free-kick, despite it looking like the ball would have crossed the line anyway.
The former Arsenal star immediately acknowledged that he had stolen his teammate's goal and, in a video that has circulated on social media, could be seen mouthing "that's your goal" to a smiling Ronaldo.
