Canelo Alvarez was ahead on two of the three scorecards when he produced a stunning KO to beat Sergey Kovalev.
The Mexican threw a devastating right hook in the penultimate round to send the light-heavyweight champion through the ropes.
And the three judges' scorecards revealed Canelo was heading for victory on points until he rendered the scores irrelevant.
Two judges had the challenger leading 96-94 while the third had the fight a draw at 95-95.
After he was crowned champion, Alvarez said: "This is just a step in my career, in my history.
"All I ask for is patience, because Canelo will make history, I guarantee.
"We knew there were going to be five or six rounds and it was going to take some time for me to get him.
"Much credit to him, heâ€™s a great fighter, but we stuck to our gameplan.
"It was delayed a little bit, but overall it was successful."
