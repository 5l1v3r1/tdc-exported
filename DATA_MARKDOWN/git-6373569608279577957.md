Shoppers have been left stunned after spotting a Cabury's Selection Box on sale for £45 in Sainsbury's.
Popular with many over the Christmas period, the above-average price tag has caused anger from customers who have described the price as a 'rip-off', The Mirror reports.
the deal was spotted by Shane Butler, who promptly posted it on the money-saving site  Latest Deals .
His post got a lot of attention, with hundreds of people pointing out how much they could save buying the chocolate themselves.
Cadbury's online description says: "Probably the World's biggest selection box, the Cadbury Ultimate Selection Box is ideal for sharing, containing 26 chocolate bars and weighing over 2 kilos.
"Best of luck fitting this under the tree...."
One user said it'd be cheaper than buying all of the chocolate bars separately, while another wrote: "Could make it myself for £25 and even have chocolate left over to do a smaller one.”
Another wrote: "It could be because there is 2 Cadburys World tickets inside and think they retail at £12.85 each."
Including those, the price drops to a far more reasonable £19.30 - making it cheaper than buying the chocolate yourself.
The limited edition box measures a massive 75cm x 48 cm x 4cm, and weighs in at 2.1kg and includes 26 chocolate bars.
