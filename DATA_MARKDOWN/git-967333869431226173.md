        As the UK 2019 December general election campaign gets underway, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will attempt to make Brexit the dominant issue and win a majority to back his EU withdrawal deal. But the Brexit Party has said that they consider Johnson's deal to be a betrayal of the 2016 vote.
      
Britain's ruling Conservative Party warned supporters on Friday that voting for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party could result in Britain's withdrawal from the EU being stopped and could put left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10 through "the back door."
An email from Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said: "A vote for Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door."
This follows an announcement by Nigel Farage on Friday that the Brexit Party would run in every seat across the UK at the 12 December general election, unless Boris Johnson drops his Brexit withdrawal agreement.
The Brexit Party leader issued a warning to Johnson that the Brexit Party would use the entire election campaign ensuring that every home is aware that his withdrawal agreement is a "sell out."
Mr Farage said "We will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales. Please don't doubt that we are ready".
"Do not underestimate our determination or organisation".
