Several reviews of Surface Pro X which were published this week mentioned about less than expected battery life and poor system stability. Microsoft has now released the first firmware update for Surface Pro X device. This November 2019 update will improve battery life and system stability. You can find the full list of available updates below.
Last month, Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro X, an ARM-powered device running full Windows 10. Instead of using a generic Snapdragon processor, Microsoft partnered with Qualcomm to create a custom SQ1 chipset to power this device. Despite being the thinnest Surface, the Surface Pro X offers decent performance and great visual experience through its virtually edge-to-edge 13” touchscreen. You can make Surface Pro X a full laptop with Surface Pro X Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen. The new Surface Pro X went on sale early this week and it is available in following variants and you can order it from Amazon today.
You can also order Surface Pro X here from Microsoft Store. Check out the new Surface Pro X keyboard here for $139 and new Slim Pen here for $145.
