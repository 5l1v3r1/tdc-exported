As it did with GTA V, Rockstar Games took its time before porting Red Dead Redemption 2 over to the PC, but it looks like it’ll be worth the wait. With support for 8K resolutions, HDR, widescreen, and multiple monitor setups, this could be one of the best-looking PC games of the year, though owners of Nvidia’s RTX cards won’t be enjoying any real-time ray tracing effects seen in games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Control.
It appeared that Nvidia was hinting RDR2 would support its RTX 20-series cards’ marquee feature when screenshots posted by the company came with “Nvidia GeForce RTX” logos in the bottom corner. With the images appearing to show some snazzy lighting, it seemed that the Western would be another to support ray tracing. Sadly, that’s not the case.
