Imagine this.
John Legend, in a onesie with his face on it and a little tipsy, crooning his 2013 hit "All of Me" on stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.
The good news is you don't have to imagine it. This wild scenario actually took place and — to the utter amusement of everyone — it was caught on camera.
Chrissy Teigen, who is married to the singer, posted the video Saturday on Twitter, writing bluntly, "John got wine drunk and sang a song at universal studios last night."
Go ahead, play that video back. It's hilarious.
