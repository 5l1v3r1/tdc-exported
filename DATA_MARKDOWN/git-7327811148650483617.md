CONCOURSE VILLAGE, Bronx (WABC) -- A correction officer from Rikers Island is among three people indicted in an alleged contraband smuggling scheme.
The Bronx District Attorney announced on Wednesday that 40-year-old Rikers Island correction officer Jason Prieto, 41-year-old former inmate Anthony Rusielwicz and 54-year-old Bronx resident Luz Pagan have been indicted on charges of smuggling heroin and tobacco into Rikers.

Pagan was released from police custody, while Prieto and Rusielwicz are awaiting bail.
