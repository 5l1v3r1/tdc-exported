Twitter teased its Topics feature back in August and now it’s set to roll out for all users soon. Topics make it easy to keep up with all the latest news you’re interested in across 300 different subjects including sports, entertainment, and gaming.
Reported by The Verge, Twitter Topics give users an easy way to keep up with what they love as it lets you see tweets of interest from credible sources that you might not follow.
Twitter’s Topics team leader, Rob Bishop noted the goal of the feature is to improve users’ daily use.
Further, Bishop shared with The Verge what’s in the pipeline for Topics:
Topics are set to roll out globally on Wednesday, November 13th.
