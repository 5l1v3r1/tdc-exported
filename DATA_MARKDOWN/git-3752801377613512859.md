President Cyril Ramaphosa turned on the charm when addressing the world conquering Springboks at the Union Buildings on Thursday, telling them "I'm glad it's not election season because all these players would be elected".
The Boks began their trophy parade through the streets of Pretoria and Johannesburg on Thursday and will move to other parts of the country in the coming days.
Fresh from a history-making victory over England – 32-12 – the Boks, led by Siya Kolisi lifted the Webb Ellis Cup for a third time in as many finals.
"I must applaud the strategy deployed by [coach] Rassie Erasmus and his team… today they are victorious as gladiators," Ramaphosa began.

"What I am pleased about is that we are not about to hold an election… if we were about to hold an election, I have no doubt that the entire [Springbok] rugby team would be in Parliament [and] in Cabinet," Ramaphosa joked.
"Kolisi would have been the president and Erasmus would be the Minister of Finance," he continued … "I'm glad I don't have to compete with Siya Kolisi right now."
