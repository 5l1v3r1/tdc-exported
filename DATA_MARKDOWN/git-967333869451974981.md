Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) has approved the initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, in a move that the CMA said would be valid for at least six months.
In a statement on Sunday, the CMA also said that Aramco’s prospectus is due to be published in the run-up to the beginning of the subscription period.
Plans for the decision were first announced in 2016 as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 economic overhaul programme but have been delayed a number of times.
Riyadh reportedly expects the IPO to value the oil giant at some $2 trillion, the largest such valuation in history, which would allow the company to raise as much as $100 billion by listing just a 5 percent stake.
The oil facilities belonging to Aramco were attacked in mid-September, which resulted in a temporary sharp decrease in the kingdom's oil output.
The Yemeni rebel Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. Riyadh blamed the incident on Iran, which for its part denied allegations.
