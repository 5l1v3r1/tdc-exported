Shah Rukh Khan promised fans on his birthday that he will definitely announce a film soon, and seems like all those rumours about the actor working with South filmmaker Atlee could soon be proved right. Atlee and his wife Priya was snapped last night at Shah Rukh Khan’s birthday celebrations and the filmmaker also shared a picture of them from the party. And his caption clearly spelled the admiration he has for the actor, “love u sir,” shared Atlee. The filmmaker is currently riding high on the success of his last release ‘Bigil’, which has set the cash registers ringing like never before.
