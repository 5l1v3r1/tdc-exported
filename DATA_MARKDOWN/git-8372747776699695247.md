Houston, we have a cookie.
Astronauts aboard the International Space Station will be able to attempt baking for the first time as a spacecraft carrying a zero-gravity oven and some cookie dough arrived Monday.
The dough comes from none other than DoubleTree by Hilton, the makers of arguably one of the most infamous chocolate chip cookies. The oven was made by Zero G Kitchen, who describe themselves as "a platform for food development in space."
"Zero-G Oven explores the possibility and challenges of baking fresh meals in a microgravity environment," a description of the NASA experiment says. "Investigators explore how to heat, then cool the space oven in a manner that is safe for all crew member interaction."
