Castro’s remarks came after Sirius XM’s Dean Obeidallah inquired about the lack of diversity among current front-runners in the Democrat primary, which includes Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
“I don’t take anything away from the people that right now are leading the pack,” Castro said. “They’ve worked very hard. They’re great, talented candidates.”
