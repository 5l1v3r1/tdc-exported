Britbox, the streaming service formed as a joint venture between the UK’s broadcasters, which came to the US over two years ago, has finally launched in its home country. For £5.99 a month (the same as a basic Netflix or Amazon Prime Video subscription), BBC News reports that viewers can get access to a range of shows, including Downton Abbey, Gavin & Stacey, Wolf Hall, Broadchurch, and Happy Valley. Eventually, the service will play host to content from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Comedy Central UK, and Channel 5.
While each UK broadcaster currently operates its own free “catch-up” services for recently broadcast shows, one of the big selling points of Britbox is the older content it will offer from broadcasters’ back catalogs. These include classic comedies like Blackadder and Fawlty Towers, dramas like Brideshead Revisited, and over 600 classic episodes of Doctor Who. Speaking to BBC News, ITV’s Reemah Sakaan called this older content a “new battleground” in the streaming wars and cited older shows like Friends that continue to draw interest over a decade after their original broadcast.
