Hillary Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shared opposing views Wednesday regarding Twitter's recent call to ban all political advertisements while gearing up for the 2020 presidential election.
Clinton praised the Twitter move and urged Facebook to follow suit, saying such moves would prevent a repeat of the spread of false information that occurred during the last presidential election.

Twitter made the right decision to say, 'Look, we don’t want to get into the judging game,'” Clinton said at The New York Times DealBook Conference in New York City. “I think that should be the decision that Facebook makes as well.”
But McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor in Washington, slammed the new Twitter policy as an effort to undermine the First Amendment right to free speech. McConnell said a ban on paid candidate and issue ads would only hurt “fledgling speakers who are not already famous.”
Clinton also encouraged Facebook to ban political ads given its track record during the 2016 presidential election, when Russian operatives spread misinformation on American politics prior to the election.
“We know unfortunately that Facebook has a history of allowing all kinds of disinformation on its platform,” Clinton said. “During the 2016 campaign, they were taking ads from a number of sources and later revealing that actually ads paid for in rubles were part of what they were putting out.”
