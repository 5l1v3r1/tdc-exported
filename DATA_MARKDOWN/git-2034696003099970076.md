        "We would also like to encourage you to join us in supporting those in need."
      
Metallica have donated $100,000 (£77,640) to the ongoing wildfire relief efforts in Northern and Southern California, via their All Within My Hands Foundation.
The rock giants announced the donation on Twitter, confirming the sum would be split equally between the Wildfire Relief Fund and the Sonoma County Resilience Fund.
“Sadly, for the third year in a row, communities we have called home throughout the state of California are again experiencing the tragedy left in the wake of wildfires,” they wrote.
