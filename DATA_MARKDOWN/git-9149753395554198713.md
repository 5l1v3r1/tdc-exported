Rockstar has rolled out an update to its launcher that, among other things, fixes some crashes that can occur when starting Red Dead Redemption 2, including the Epic Games Store version.
Here's the full changelog:
To update the launcher, close any Rockstar games that may be running, and then close the launcher itself by right-clicking the icon in the Windows taskbar and selecting exit. Then restart it (I always like to wait a beat first) and the update should apply automatically.
Some users on Twitter are saying that the update has not corrected their issues, but if you're having troubles it's worth a shot. We've also got an ongoing rundown of other possible fixes and workaround that you can keep up with here.
