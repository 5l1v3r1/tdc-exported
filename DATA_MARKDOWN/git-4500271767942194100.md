PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto on Tuesday alleged that his father, former president Asif Ali Zardari, has not been given access to specialist doctors and his personal physician.
"Our family is increasingly concerned about his health. If anything happens to our father, this government will be held responsible," he said on Twitter.
