There are multiple complaints of iOS 13.2 killing background apps ‘so aggressively that iOS effectively doesn’t offer multitasking anymore.’ The latest iOS update was released on Monday, adding Deep Fusion, new emoji, Siri privacy settings and more.
Overcast developer Marco Arment made the complaint on Twitter, with many others echoing his experience …
He goes on to suggest that Apple is not allowing its own developers enough time to identify and fix bugs before updates are released.
Daring Fireball’s John Gruber says the same happens to him.
Others report the same experience in replies to Arment’s tweet.
Quite a few others complain of blank webpages in Safari, the content only loading in Reader view.
