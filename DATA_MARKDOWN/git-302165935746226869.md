SHENZHEN, Nov 3 — World number one Ashleigh Barty spectacularly ended her jinx against defending champion Elina Svitolina to win the WTA Finals today and scoop the richest prize in tennis history.
Barty, who had never beaten Svitolina in five previous attempts, won 6-4, 6-3 in one hour and 26 minutes at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre.
The Australian claimed a record-setting US$4.42 million (RM18.4 million) payday — the biggest ever awarded in men’s or women’s tennis. — AFP
