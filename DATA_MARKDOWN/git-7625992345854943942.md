Andrew Jones didn't just return to basketball competition Tuesday after a long absence. He took a star turn.
Jones, absent for nearly two years while receiving treatment for leukemia, rejoined the Texas rotation and scored a career-best 20 points in 29 minutes. The Longhorns defeated Northern Colorado 69-45 in the opener for both teams.
"I didn't know what to expect," Jones, a redshirt sophomore guard, said. "It was a great feeling to be back out there. I didn't have any jitters. I wasn't nervous."
CBSSports.com reports Jones was among college basketball's biggest under-the-radar breakout contenders before his leukemia diagnosis.
