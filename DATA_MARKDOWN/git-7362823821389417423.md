A man in Milwaukee allegedly threw battery acid on another man's face Friday night, police said, adding that it stemmed from an argument over a parking spot.
Mahud Villalaz, 42, suffered second-degree burns on his face, Fox 6 reported. Police did not respond to Fox News' request for comment, but the Journal Sentinel reported officers were investigating the incident as a racially motivated hate crime.
Speaking before reporters Saturday, Villalaz said he no longer felt safe to go outside.
