BOSTON - We all know reading is fundamental, but can reading improve health outcomes? For 30 years, Reach Out and Read has proven it can. 
The national nonprofit started at Boston City Hospital, now Boston Medical Center, in 1989 with a group of pediatricians who gave parents the knowledge and the tools they need to make reading to their children a daily routine. 
"We make sure the child is growing and sleeping and doesn't have rashes, but fundamentally, what we're doing is supporting that incredible energy that parents bring to need to nurture their kids," said Dr. Robert Needlman, founder of Reach Out and Read.
Now, the program is in all 50 states and works to educate health care providers.
