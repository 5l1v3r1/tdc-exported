The 2020 Jaguar F-Type has been recalled due to models with the 3.0-litre supercharged V6 making too much noise.
It appears you can have too much of a good thing, because Jaguar says the "static noise level exceeds the regulated maximum decibel limit" in the F-Type V6.
A total of 28 cars are included in the campaign â€“ a VIN list is attached here.
Jaguar will contact owners of the affected vehicles and advise them to organise a free 'fix' with their nearest dealership.
The original recall notice is attached here.
