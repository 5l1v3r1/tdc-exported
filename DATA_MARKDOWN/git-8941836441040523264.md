STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) - Billed as the largest Native American gathering in Georgia, the four-day Native American Festival and Pow Wow is preparing for this week’s showcase of the culture through dance, music and more.
The festival will be held Nov. 7-10 at Stone Mountain Park.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the event will feature tribes from across the U.S. and Central America.
According to the event’s website , visitors can learn about the culture through “dance, music, authentic craft demonstrations, cooking traditions, storytelling, wildlife presentations and more.”
Demonstrations will include skills such as flint-knapping, bow making, fire starting, open fire cooking and pottery, plus an encampment where kids and adults can go inside traditional dwellings. Other popular highlights include the inter-tribal dance and drum competitions.
