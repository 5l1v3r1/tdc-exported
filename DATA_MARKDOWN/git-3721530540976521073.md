Anthem’s chief developer for live service — aka the whole reason the game was made, basically — has left the studio. It’s another sign that BioWare’s sci-fi, open-world big bet probably won’t be getting that familiar “OK, now it’s a good game” redemption story after a year’s worth of post-release support.
Chad Robertson announced via Twitter on Thursday that he would be leaving BioWare after 14 years with the company. As the live service director, Robertson had been the public face behind the promises that Anthem would be getting better, following a thud of a launch in February and major revisions to its content roadmap soon after.
