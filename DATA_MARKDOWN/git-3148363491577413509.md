Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party’s election campaign on Friday, telling Prime Minister Boris Johnson to “drop the deal because it’s not Brexit”. Mr Farage said that his offer of an election pact with Mr Johnson remains on the table.
However, Conservative party chairman James Cleverly and Brexiteer Spartans Mark Francois and Steve Baker rejected the offer of a Leave Alliance. Mr Baker, chairman of the European Research Group (ERG), said in comments reported by the Daily Mail that it was “completely inconceivable” the Tories would back a no-deal Brexit.
“I am no more willing to be bullied by Nigel Farage than anyone else into acting against my best understanding of the national interest,” Mr Baker said.
“The reason every Conservative Eurosceptic MP backed the deal is that it can deliver a Brexit worth having,” he added.
However, the Brexit Party said that the Tories are “misrepresenting” the party’s position. A party spokesman told Breitbart London: “If Mr Baker is indeed telling this to the media, he is deliberately misrepresenting our very reasonable position, which Nigel clearly laid out today. We have, and continue to, put county before party.”
