Sunil Bharala, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has come up with a bizarre suggestion to improve air quality. He claimed that farmers have always practiced stubble burning and that this is a “natural system”.
His comments come as political mudslinging has begun between states adjacent to the national capital New Delhi, the state government of Delhi and the federal ministry of environment and forests as to who is responsible for the worsening air quality situation in the national capital.
The air quality in New Delhi, meanwhile, worsened again on Sunday evening, according to SAFAR-India Air Quality Service provided by the federal Ministry of Earth Sciences.
The Air Quality Index measures the concentration of tiny particles that are less than 2.5 microns in diameter and can be carried deep into the lungs, causing deadly diseases including cancer and cardiac problems.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has, for instance, described the city as a “gas chamber" and claimed that people in Delhi were suffering through no fault of their own.
