        With preparations for December’s snap general election unfolding in the UK, representatives of the country’s two leading parties have engaged in a heated Twitter debate following an anti-Semitic comment by a user who claimed to be a member of the Labour Party.
      
A Conservative British minister, Michael Gove, wound up in hot water this week after he shared an anti-Semitic tweet from an alleged member of the Labour Party-backed Momentum group and urged Jeremy Corbyn along with his top supporters to condemn the post. However, as was later revealed, the person did not belong to either of the organisations, prompting representatives of the Labour Party and Momentum group to call on Gove to publicly apologise for the blunder.
