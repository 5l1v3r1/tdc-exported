Internet users are calling out Kylie Jenner for posting her Instagram Stories at the wrong timing. The 22-year-old was seen using the social media app while driving her US$3 million Bugatti to her mother’s 64th birthday celebration. Many have raised their voices towards Jenner’s reckless behavior, calling her irresponsible for using her phone behind the wheel as it puts both her and others in danger. A Twitter user claims that this isn’t the first time Jenner has documented herself while driving on the road. This is not only dangerous but also illegal where Jenner lives, and many are surprised at how many times the billionaire has gotten away with pulling such a risky move. Another Twitter user questions, “Why does Kylie Jenner constantly take videos of herself driving?” adding, “Does she genuinely think it makes her look cool? Because all I see is an immature girl with no consideration for the people she’s putting in danger.” Jenner has not responded to the criticism. Advertisement Advertisement
