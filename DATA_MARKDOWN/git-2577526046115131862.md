Despite their prevalence in some corners of the internet, I feel like it should come as no surprise that if you make use of cheats in a competitive multiplayer game, you run the risk of getting banned. Unfortunately for Faze clan Fortnite player Jarvis, that nugget of information appeared to pass him by, and now Epic’s banned him for life.
In a video posted last night, Jarvis uploaded a video titled “I’ve been banned from Fortnite (I’m Sorry),” in which he expressed the extent to which the battle royale had changed his life before telling fans that “I’ve actually been banned on fortnite for life.”
