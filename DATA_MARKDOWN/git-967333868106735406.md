        New Delhi (Sputnik): While anonymous letters are threatening terror attacks in India’s national capital, the eventful city of New Delhi is bracing itself to host international cricket matches despite pollution levels breaching the “critical” mark.
      
Starting 3 November, the men’s Indian cricket team is scheduled to play three T-20 matches against its neighbouring country Bangladesh. Despite Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal calling the city a “gas chamber” on Friday, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has refused to shift the match-venue to another city.
