Greg Schultz, the former vice president’s campaign manager, lambasted the senator for having been a “Republican until she was 47-years-old,” in response to comments Warren made in Iowa earlier during the day, claiming Biden was “running in the wrong presidential primary.”
“You have to be kidding me,” Schultz said. “Warren was a Republican until she was 47 years old while Joe Biden has spent his life helping elect Democrats across the country and served with honor in the Senate and with Pres. Obama.”
