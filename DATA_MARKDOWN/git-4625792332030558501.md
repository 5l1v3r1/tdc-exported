The View co-host Meghan McCain has spent the last week in a feud with Sen. Cory Booker and his campaign team after the New Jersey Democrat appeared on the show to talk about his presidential campaign.
McCain asked Booker to clarify his position on gun buybacks, which she compared to Beto O'Rourke, who she called "crazy." Booker responded to McCain by lecturing her on being civil towards opponents and advising her not to "tear the character of people down." The senator then did not respond with specifics of how he would remove the guns he wants to ban from people who are unwilling to give them up.
