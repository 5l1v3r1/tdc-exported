        Cats and dogs are often portrayed as enemies, between whom there is never mutual understanding and friendship. Sooner or later if not friendship, then at least mutual understanding arises a dog and a cat. Their further development depends on the character of the cat and dog, their temperament, the characteristics of the breed, etc.
      
There is even a saying: "They live like a cat with a dog." But, it seems that its meaning should have changed for a long time ago. After all, dogs and cats very often make friends, take care of each other.
