The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has unveiled a list of commodities and products suspended due to substandard value, with a directive to all companies manufacturing them to discontinue.
Through a Twitter post, KEBS made it clear to the public that the products had been suspended stating that after a market surveillance the products were found to contain higher amounts of levels of Aflatoxin  hence unfit for human consumption.
A directive was also sent to all companies to recall the already manufactured products with an instituted plan to take corrective actions on the same.
“Kenya Bureau of Standards wishes to inform the public that the following products have been suspended and the companies manufacturing them instructed to discontinue, recall all the substandard products as well as institute corrective actions,” read the Twitter post.
