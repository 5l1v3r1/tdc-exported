A man who was stabbed to death outside a Maryland Popeyes Monday night had cut to the front of a line to get dibs on the chain's popular chicken sandwich, police said on Tuesday.
Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski told reporters that 28-year-old Kevin Davis entered the restaurant in Oxon Hill and started “methodically” cutting a line reserved for the menu item. Stawinski said that Davis was confronted by another man when he cut to the front of the line.
“Over the course of fifteen minutes this individual works his way methodically ahead of everybody else in that line, is confronted by this individual and then from the moment of that confrontation, 15 seconds later, the two of them are out in front of the store, a stabbing occurs and an individual’s life is lost,” Stawinski told reporters.

He added, “The question my detectives have to answer is: how does a confrontation lead to a homicide in 15 seconds?”
