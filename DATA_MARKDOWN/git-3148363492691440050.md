Turkey’s warning comes despite the unwillingness of Europe states to take them in, with the UK in particular even going so far as to strip known jihadis of their citizenship.
“We are not going to keep them until the end of time,” Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters. “We’re not a hotel for Daesh,” he said, using another name for Islamic State.
He said Turkey would hold captured foreign fighters “for some time. After that we’ll send them back to their countries”.
Soylu said E.U. countries including the Netherlands and Britain had stripped some of the fighters of their nationality to prevent Ankara from sending them home.
“They found an easy solution,” he said. “They say ‘I took his nationality away, it’s your problem now’. That’s unacceptable in our view, that’s totally irresponsible. What do you want me to do with your terrorist?”
Last year two captured Islamic State terrorists complained the UK was too harsh on them after the alleged members of ‘the Beatles’  execution team were stripped of their UK citizenship.
