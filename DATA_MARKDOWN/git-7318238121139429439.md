Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will not stand in the UK election on December 12, choosing instead to campaign countywide against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's EU divorce deal.
Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999 - until December 2018 with UKIP - confirmed that he would not run as an MP.
Farage has tried and failed to join the British parliament on no less than seven occasions, in five general elections and two by-elections. In his last run in South Thanet in 2015 he lost by just 3,000 votes.
"I have thought very hard about this: How do I serve the cause of Brexit best?" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday.
"Do I find a seat and try to get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I've decided the latter course is the right one."
"We will explain to people why Boris' Brexit is a betrayal of the hopes of 17.4 m," he added on Twitter, with reference to those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
