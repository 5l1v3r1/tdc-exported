Delta Air Lines will show unedited versions of “Booksmart” and “Rocketman” in its in-flight film offerings after critics called out the airline for censoring sexuality, including same-sex love, in previously deleted scenes.
The company said in a statement Thursday that it did not ask for any “homosexual content” to be removed from the films.
“We value our in-flight entertainment options as a means to reflect the diversity of the world,” the company said. “We are reviewing the processes of our third-party editing vendors to ensure that they are aligned with our values of diversity and inclusion.”

The issue of censorship emerged after “Booksmart” director Olivia Wilde called out deleted scenes showing lesbian sex and masturbation. The edited version, she said, also censored the words “vagina” and “lesbian.”
“What message is this sending to viewers and especially to women? That their bodies are obscene? That their sexuality is shameful?” Wilde tweeted.
