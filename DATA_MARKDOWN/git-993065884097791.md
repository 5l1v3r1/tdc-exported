SINN Féin is to stand aside in South Belfast, boosting significantly the prospects of Claire Hanna retaking the seat for the SDLP.
The move came within hours of the SDLP's Nichola Mallon announcing that she would not contest North Belfast, where Sinn Féin lord mayor John Finucane is hoping to overturn a DUP majority of just over 2,000.
Sinn Féin will also follow the SDLP's example by not standing in East Belfast and North Down in an effort to help respective pro-Remain candidates Naomi Long of Alliance and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.
The party's approach in North Down is especially noteworthy given that it is explicitly urging its supporters to vote for a unionist.
