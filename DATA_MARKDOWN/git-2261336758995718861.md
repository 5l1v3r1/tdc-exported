It’s fight night in Las Vegas!
Tonight (November 2nd) from the MGM Grand Garden Arena sees middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2, 35 KOs) jump two weight classes up to 175 lbs, where awaiting him is WBO light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs). Alvarez has never fought at 175 lbs before, and while Kovalev may be past his best, he’s still a major titleholder and one of the hardest punchers in his division. Canelo will have the speed advantage and is the more skilled boxer, but he will obviously be the smaller man in the ring.
Canelo’s quest for a world title in a fourth division will air exclusively on DAZN. While the four-fight main card starts at 9 PM ET, the main event will happen after the conclusion of UFC 244: Masvidal vs. Diaz. Yeah, we know what the big show is this evening.
Prelims will stream right here on Bloody Elbow at 6:30 PM ET/3:30 PM PT.
