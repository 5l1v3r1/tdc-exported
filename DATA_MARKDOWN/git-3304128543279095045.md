The opposition leader for Uganda, Kizza Besigye has been arrested and taken to an unknown destination by the police.
This is in relation to a planned assembly by the Forum of Democratic Change (FDC ) party at Mandela Stadium in Namboole.
The police and military officers who were heavily armed blocked the stadium, a move that angered the FDC party members and the people who had already assembled, igniting chaos.
Several leaders of the opposition party were expected to attend the assembly, and with the police failing to control the huge chaotic crowds with teargas, water canons and live bullets, they went after the leaders who were believed to be the organizers of the assembly.
According to reports by the authorities, Besigye refused to comply to the orders and was instead waving at the crowds of people from his vehicle.
