LEE COUNTY, Fla. â€” The Lee County Sheriffs were called about a sex crime at home in Fort Myers.
The victim told a parent that the sexual abuse started when they were five years old.
The man threatened the child and their family, and that is why the child did not report it.
Detectives quickly began an investigation and found probable cause to arrest Antonio Becerril Soria, 44.
Soria was tracked down and arrested by the Fugitive Warrants Unit.
Soria was charged with Sexual Capital Battery and Lewd/Lascivious Behavior.
