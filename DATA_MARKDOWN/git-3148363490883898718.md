“Do I believe Conan should receive a Purple Heart for actions on target? Absolutely,” former Army Ranger Michael Bollinger told the New York Post. “They’re out there with us every step of the way.”
James Knuppenburg, who was awarded a Purple Heart after a sniper shot him in Kandahar, Afghanistan, concurs with Bollinger, also telling the Post that Conan deserves the medal.
Knuppenburg said:
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced Conan would visit the White House and shared a meme of himself awarding the heroic dog a Medal of Honor, prompting the establishment media to whip itself up into a fury.
