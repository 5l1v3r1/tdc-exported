        In another huge development for Maker Protocol and open finance, DAI has hit its 100 million ceiling, and the community is going in for an executive vote on November 8. The vote to raise the ceiling is expected to be approved unanimously as DAI becomes an integral part of the open finance stack, November 7, 2019.
      
In July 2018, MakerDAO held an executive vote to raise the debt ceiling from 50 million to 100 million. A little less than a year and a half later, the ceiling has once again been smashed and MKR holders will convene to vote on whether the ceiling should be raised or not.
