SEPANG, Nov 2 — Indonesian rider Afridza Munandar died after being involved in an incident in the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup (IATC) race at the Sepang International Circuit today. 
According to a statement issued by MotoGP, the incident occurred at Turn 10 on Lap 1, with the race red flagged immediately thereafter. 
The 20-year-old rider received medical attention by the side of the track before being transferred to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) by helicopter.
