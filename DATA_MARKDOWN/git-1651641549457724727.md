        God of War PC is a far-away dream for the game’s director Cory Barlog, but it will probably never come.
      
After the surprising announcement that Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding would be coming to PC, Barlog expressed his wish for other games to come to the platform.
With Playstation fans upset that their proposed console exclusive will soon be playable on PC, Barlog took to Twitter to explain his thoughts on the subject.
“Does Death Stranding’s non-exclusivity matter?” asked the director. “Not in the least!”
When a fan replied to Barlog to suggest a full PC port of his recent God of War sequel, Barlog seemed enthusiastic about the subject.
“You know, I would love that,” Barlog replied. “It is, sadly, a decision far above my paygrade. As is proven on a daily basis, I am no Kojima.”
