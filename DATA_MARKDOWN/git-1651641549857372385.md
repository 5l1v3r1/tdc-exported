Google News has gotten better for polyglots with an update rolling out today. The firm has included a feature that lets users specify up to two languages with one as a primary. This means you’ll be able to select say English (United Kingdom) and French to receive news in both languages without having to switch each time — it’ll appear in your primary news feed. Of course, you’ll still see the news in your primary language first and foremost.
Google says this feature is available across 141 countries and 41 languages, so you have a decent chance of being one of the lucky ones. The update is available now for users on both iOS and Android.
