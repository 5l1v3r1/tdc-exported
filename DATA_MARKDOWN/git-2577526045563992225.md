Clocking in at seven minutes long, this is the longest advert to ever air on Japanese television. Sure, this is an ad, but itâ€™s like a seven-minute short-film about people into Final Fantasy VII.
As pointed out on GameSpark, the advert aired during an annual 27-hour block of programming hosted by Beat Takeshi that aired over the weekend.
The spot stars popular actors Masataka Kubota, Misato Morita, and Tetsuji Tamayama.
