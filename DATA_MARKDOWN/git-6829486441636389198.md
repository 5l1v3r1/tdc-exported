Yesterday, Frontier Touring dropped a video hinting at a surprise 2020 tour from a major American act. And uh, not to ruin the surprise or anything, but it’s definitely Tool.
It’s not exactly what the video says that gives it away, but rather how it says it. See, the thing’s extremely simple: a series of Australian cities flash up over a black background, the words slowly distorting. In most cases, it’d barely appear like a clue at all.
But then there’s the question of font. There’s no mistaking the lettering style of those Aussie place names: it’s the same one that appears on the front cover of the new Tool record, Fear Inoculum. I mean like — exactly the same.
