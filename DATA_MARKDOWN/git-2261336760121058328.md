Colby Covington seemed to have caught Kamaru Usman by surprise at yesterday’s UFC 245 pre-fight press conference in New York, accusing the welterweight champion of using EPO, the injectable-only performance-enhancing drug former bantamweight titleholder T.J. Dillashaw tested positive for at UFC on ESPN+1.
“Everybody knows the Blackzilians team is notorious for doing steroids,” Covington said about Usman’s team, per MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin. “Anthony Johnson, Rashad Evans, all the guys over there, Alistair Overeem when he was over there.
“I have inside information that he was doing EPO for a couple years and that’s just that. That’s a fact. He has no good response. He can’t even defend himself. I think it’s pretty clear he’s on steroids but it’s not going to make a difference because when I get my hands on him, he will melt.
“I’ll pay you $25,000 if you can pee in a cup right now and it passes,” Covington added. “I will. I’ll put it up right now.”
