A team of astronomers from Ohio State University has announced that the apparent discovery of an object belonging to a previously unknown class of black holes.
Having published their findings in Science magazine, the researchers argued that there could actually be black holes out there that are much smaller that the smallest of the currently known black holes.
The object which piqued the teamâ€™s curiosity and which led them to these conclusions is a strange celestial body orbited by a giant red star, smaller than other black holes in the Milky Way but larger that the majority of known neutron stars.
Upon further analysis, the researchers concluded that the object they found was actually a small black hole whose mass is about 3.3 times that of the sun.
