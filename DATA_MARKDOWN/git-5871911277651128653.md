Cowboys legend Dez Bryant spent nearly the entirety of his career with the team, having been drafted in the first round back in 2010, and sticking around in Dallas until 2017.
Bryant was optimistic about getting an opportunity to catch passes from future Hall of Famer Drew Brees in New Orleans afterward, but an Achilles injury he suffered during practice prevented him from doing so.
As such, Bryant has remained unsigned, but heâ€™s continued to work out, and has posted videos of him doing so. Not only that, he and his agent appear to be trying to get him an opportunity to latch onto an NFL team for their stretch run.
