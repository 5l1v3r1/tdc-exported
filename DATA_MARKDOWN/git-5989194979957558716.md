        Swedish transport authorities on Wednesday morning warned of cancellations and delays on the railway between Stockholm and Uppsala – one of the busiest commuter routes in the country.
      
The problem is not expected to be resolved until 6am on Thursday, said the Swedish Transport Administration, which urged travellers to keep an eye on their departure for more information.
All trains on the route are affected by the delays and cancellations, including Arlanda Express to the airport, SJ's long-distance and inter-city trains between Uppsala and Stockholm, and SL's commuter trains between Märsta/Uppsala and Stockholm City.
The delays are due to a problem with the tracks between Upplands Väsby and Häggvik.
There were further headaches for commuters on Wednesday morning after a wheel loader hit a flyover between Häggvik and Norrviken at around 10.30am, bringing trains to a standstill south of Upplands Väsby.
The Local Sweden's editor Emma Löfgren was one of those passengers caught in the disruption.
