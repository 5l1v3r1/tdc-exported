        The second batch of Pinebook Pro pre-orders went live this week, just as buyers of the first wave begun to receive their devices!
      
And, naturally, as youâ€™d expect, in true millennial tech ownership style, a swathe of Pinebook Pro unboxing videos started to sprout out of the webâ€™s fertile mantle.
Including the following comprehensive run-through by YouTuber jpakkane1 (a link to which landed in the omg! tip box yesterday, so thanks Sadat!).
This 10 minute clip has everything you could possibly want to see: a literal unboxing; first boot experience; side-by-side comparison with (unfair klaxon sound) a 13.1â€³ MacBook (!); and connection to an external display.
AND should you make it all the way to the end thereâ€™s even some disassembly pr0n (if youâ€™re into that sort of thing ofc ðŸ˜‰).
