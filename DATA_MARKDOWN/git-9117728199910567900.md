        Sebastian Vettel was seen in the drivers cool-down room after the US Grand Prix and went over the speak to Lewis Hamilton who had just won his sixth world title. The Ferrari driver congratulated the Mercedes champion who is now only one title away from Michael Schumacher's record. 
      
"I think now is the time for you to write as many good things as you can. If somebody wins the title six times he deserves all of it. That's what I told him as well." Vettel said to Sky Sports. 

        "Obviously I'm happy for him, I'm not happy that we are not in contention this year and we were so far back. 
      

        "But you need to respect what he achieved the last years and also this year, together with his team how strong they have been.
      

        "I'm happy for him but less happy for us."
      
Vettel will hope that Ferrari are competitive from the first race next season and that he can launch a genuine challenge to end the era of Mercedes dominance.
