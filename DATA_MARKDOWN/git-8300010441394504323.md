KNIGHTDALE, N.C. -- An assistant high school football coach in Wake County is out of a job after a video showing him making racist remarks was posted to Instagram."15 seconds of fame in the wrong way. I've ruined the last 12 years of my career," John Hoskins told ABC11 exclusively.He said it happened one fun night at the bar. The 32-year-old coach at Knightdale High School was celebrating the team's win against Corinth Holders High, when he shouted: "White power, Knightdale. I still love you, N-----""Just to set the record, I'm not racist," Hoskins told ABC11 on Tuesday. "I don't mean it in a negative way."Hoskins said he was caught up in a celebratory moment with friends both black and white.He said through the years, his friends who are black have said it was OK for him to use the n-word."I guess I've been around them for so long. We're friends. I mean nothing from it," he said. "The word can be used in multiple ways. They treat me as any of their own friends."Hoskins deleted the video but not before someone reported it and shared it with school administrators.
