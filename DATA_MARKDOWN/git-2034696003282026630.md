        It's a strong return
      
Dave has released ‘Paper Cuts’, which hears the south London star experiment with drill.
The track first emerged on social media last night (November 6) and sees the Mercury Prize winner exploring the genre – popularised by stars including Headie One – for the first time.
“It’s incredible scenes / You can’t make this up / Two times that a man lost blood / Football and paper cuts,” Dave raps on the track.
It’s also his first track since winning the Mercury Prize in September for his acclaimed debut album ‘Psychodrama‘.
“I don’t know what to say,” Dave said in his acceptance speech at the time. “I want to firstly thank God. I want to invite my mum up onto stage.
