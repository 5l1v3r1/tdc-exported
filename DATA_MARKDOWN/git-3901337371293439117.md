Towards the end of last month, Messi netted a brace in Barcelona's 5-1 win over Real Valladolid, and in doing so, surpassed Ronaldo's tally of 606 club goals despite having played 118 fewer matches.
The 32-year-old scored again this past weekend, during the Blaugrana's shock defeat to Levante, to take his tally to 609, and after that match, an incredible statistic emerged surrounding the nature of his goals.
According to ESPN, who cited Gracenote, the Argentina international's penalty goal against Levante was the 500th time he had scored with his left foot for Barca, which amounts to 82.1% of all of his strikes for the club.
