HUNTINGTON STATION, Long Island (WABC) -- Meet the newest Eyewitness News reporter!
Meteorologist Lee Goldberg told the Eyewitness News team that we needed to bolster our reporter staff for Halloween, so we called up 8-year-old Peyton Dilbert to give us the latest from Long Island.
From Huntington Station, Peyton told Channel 7 viewers that they should expect clouds and mild weather.
"It's not too cold. It's not too hot," he said during his live report.
He also predicted plenty of M&M's and Reese's Pieces in the trick-or-treating forecast.
This Halloween, Peyton dressed up as an Eyewitness News reporter -- with our signature Circle 7 microphone included. We found him after his dad tweeted a photo of the costume and tagged the Eyewitness News Weekend Morning team.
"My Son Loves watching you guys in the morning!!!!! He wants to be a ABC 7 reporter," he tweeted.
