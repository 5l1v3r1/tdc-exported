Pitcher Sean Doolittle does not plan to attend the 1:15 p.m. ceremony on the White House South Lawn, The Washington Post reported.
"At the end of the day, as much as I wanted to be there with my teammates and share that experience with my teammates, I can't do it," Doolittle told the Post. "I just can't do it."
President Donald Trump congratulated the team on social media Wednesday after they beat the Astros 6-2, in Game 7. It was the team's first title since 1924 when they were called the Senators.
