The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Friday sent a message of condolence to President Arif Alvi following the Tezgam inferno near the town of Rahim Yar Khan which killed 74 people.
Prince William and his wife Kate, recently visited Pakistan in October for the first time.
“Having just returned from visiting Pakistan, we were horrified and deeply saddened to hear about the tragic fire on the Tezgam train near Rahim Yar Khan,” said a statement issued by the Kensington Palace.
At least 74 lives were snuffed out when a blaze ignited reportedly by a cooking gas cylinder blast swept through a passenger train which was en route to Rawalpindi from Karachi on Thursday.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in their message to President Alvi added, “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the people and families affected by this heart-breaking disaster.”
