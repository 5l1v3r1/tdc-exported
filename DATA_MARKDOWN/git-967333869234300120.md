        New Delhi (Sputnik): The Nepal government has issued a strong objection over a new political map released by India that places a disputed tract of land lying between both countries within India’s borders.
      
Placing the Kalapani region in Nepal’s Darchula district within Indian borders as shown in a new map created by the Indian Home Ministry has ignited a storm in on social media.
Kalapani, a 35-square kilometer area claimed by both India and Nepal, has been embroiled in controversy since mid-1996, shortly after the ratification of the Mahakali Treaty with India by Nepal’s Parliament.
A majority of netizens, both of Indian and Nepali origin, have questioned this development.
