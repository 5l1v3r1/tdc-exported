Overwatch 2 is on the way, which looks like a massive change to the core gameplay of the popular hero shooter from Blizzard. There are new heroes on the way as well, including Sojourn.
Sojourn has been a figure in the history of Overwatch since the game’s launch. She originally showed up in the animated short Recall as one of the agents who received the message to re-join Overwatch. She later appeared in Ana’s Origins video as a member of Ana’s team, suggesting strong relationships with other heroes like Soldier: 76, McCree, and Reinhardt.
She was most prominent in the Overwatch Archives event Storm Rising, where she took the role of Captain Sojourn. It seems like she may have moved into Ana Amari’s role after the latter was presumed to be dead.
Sojourn’s addition to the roster comes in light of other big announcements, including PVE modes and new looks for the old heroes.
