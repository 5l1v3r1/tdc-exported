Actress Debra Messing criticized "The View," describing the daytime show as "irresponsible" for hosting Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, on Thursday.
"@TheView Why would you bring him on? You trying to be 'balanced?'" she tweeted.
"He and his family have assaulted our country, our democracy, our environment, our national security, moral compass. Very very disappointing and irresponsible decision imo," she added, using the acronym for "in my opinion."
Trump Jr. appeared on "The View" to promote his new book but ended up creating fireworks on other issues as the co-hosts asked him several critical questions.
