A famous shoe manufacturer, Bata has staged a comeback in Nigeria as it launched a new factory worth N350 million in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, to aid local production of footwear in Nigeria.
The manufacturer has employed artisans that have started manufacturing footwear that would soon hit the market.
What it means: The shoemaker that left Nigeria in the 80’s has returned to the most populous black nation and is expected to generate employment for the teeming youth while the internally generated revenue would also witness a boost.
An executive of the company, Tobe Eze, who disclosed during the official visit of some officials of Standard Organisation of Nigeria to the facility, explained that the brand returned to the country last April when it imported some shoes.
