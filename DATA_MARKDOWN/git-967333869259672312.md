Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin said Tuesday that Russia was ready to assist talks between the Kurds and Damascus on Kurdish units of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) joining the Syrian government’s army.
When asked a clarifying question if Russia is ready to assist talks on the Kurdish People's Protection Units of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) joining the Syrian government army, Vershinin said Moscow was ready for this "on all aspects."
At the same time, the Russian Defence Ministry has stated that the country’s forces together with their Turkish colleagues have begun their second patrol in northwestern Syria.
The servicemen are driving armoured vehicles. As many as eight units of military equipment and around 50 servicemen are engaged in the operation.
In late-October, the SDF announced the complete withdrawal of troops from the border area between Syria and Turkey. The SDF stressed that the Syrian government border guards would be deployed to the Syrian-Turkish border.
