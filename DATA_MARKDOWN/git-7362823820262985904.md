Police in Texas are asking for the public's help after a local veteran's service dog was stolen last month.
Someone took Rosalyn, a 2-year-old mastiff, from Emmanuel Bernadin's home after breaking in on Oct. 19, according to the Arlington Police Department.
Roslyn, or Roz for short, is Bernadin's service animal and medical alert dog, police said.
