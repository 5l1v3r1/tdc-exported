CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€“ Cape Coral will be the site of the new Family Initiative Autism Support Center early next year.
Local leaders joined more than 100 people for the groundbreaking in Southwest Cape Coral on Thursday.
The center will provide brand new clinical services to children and teens on the autism spectrum. It will also be a support location for families with additional resources.
The president of the center says new space will help further serve the community.
"We want this space to be as flexible as possible, so it's going to offer a lot of different opportunities for families. Activity space, space to provide clinical services...I think most important to us, a space to provide education and training and facilitate conversation," said David Brown.
The building is named after Senator Lizbeth Benaquisto, in honor of her support for the organization.
