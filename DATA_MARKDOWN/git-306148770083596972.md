Yesterday, on late Halloween night, Google engineers delivered the best scare of the evening and released an urgent update for the Chrome browser to patch an actively exploited zero-day. From a report: "Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2019-13720 exists in the wild," Google engineers said in a blog post announcing the new v78.0.3904.87 release. The actively-exploited zero-day was described as a use-aster-free bug in Chrome's audio component. Use-after-free vulnerabilities are memory corruption bugs that occur when an application tries to reference memory that was previously assigned to it but has been freed or deleted in the meantime. This usually causes a program to crash, but can also sometimes lead to other, unintended consequences, such as code execution scenarios. Google credited Anton Ivanov and Alexey Kulaev, two malware researchers from Kaspersky, with reporting the issue. According to a blog post published after this article's publication, Kaspersky said the zero-day was being used to install malware on user devices. It was being deployed on user devices via a Korean-language news portal.
