Removing President Trump from office would "blow a hole" in the legitimacy of the U.S. government, National Review editor Rich Lowry said Sunday.
Lowry cited an NPR/Marist poll on NBC News' "Meet the Press," showing 52 percent of respondents favoring an impeachment inquiry. He said the number was deceiving, however, because 58 percent would rather see the issue resolved with an election in 2020, instead of leaving it in the hands of Congress. "That’s a very strong suit for Republicans," he said.
Lowry added, "I just don’t think removing him would actually, at the end of the day, be good for the country. It would blow a hole of legitimacy at the center of our national politics that would take years to heal."
