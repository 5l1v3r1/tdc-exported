LEE COUNTY, Fla. â€” Bonita Springs Community Police Deputies jumped into action for an eleven-year-old girl by getting her a new bicycle and helmet after she was hit by a vehicle.
When 11-year old Dolce was hit by a vehicle while riding her bicycle to school, deputies helped her, and thankfully she only had minor injuries, but her bike was totaled.
Dolce lives within a two-mile radius of her school, so a bicycle is the quickest form of transportation. The deputies were able to get her a new bike so she can now get to school safely and quickly.
