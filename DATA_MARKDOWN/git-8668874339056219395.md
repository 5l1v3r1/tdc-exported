The World Rugby player of the year shortlist has been announced, and three players from this Saturday’s Rugby World Cup final have made the list.
Rugby Championship winners and RWC finalists Pieter-Steph du Toit and Cheslin Kolbe are nominees, as is their opponent on Saturday Tom Curry.
Elsewhere, Wales’ Grand Slam-winning captain Alun-Wyn Jones has earned a place, as has the All Blacks’ flanker Ardie Savea.
The final place on the list is taken by the United States’ Joe Taufete’e, who becomes the first player from a tier two nation to be selected. The hooker became international rugby’s top try-scoring front row forward earlier this year, overtaking 2001 player of the year Keith Wood, and now has 20 tries in 27 Tests.
Many people have been campaigning for a player from a tier two nation to make this list, and while it is something to be celebrated, the choice of player has raised a few eyebrows given the RWC we have just witnessed.
