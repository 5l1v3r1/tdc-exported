A new book has revealed that unnamed top CIA staffers compared the administrations of US President Donald J. Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama, asserting that Obama’s White House "micromanaged" CIA affairs, but was concerned with “political correctness", according to Fox News.
The book, written by political and religious pundit Doug Wead, stated, citing anonymous sources that were purported to have been assigned inside the White House that CIA staffers revealed their complaints against the Obama administration in a meeting with former CIA director Mike Pompeo.
According to Fox, the Trump administration has a decentralised form of management that allows more freedom for agencies.
"The new Trump theory was to let them make choices. If they’re not making those decisions themselves, then we can always pull it back up. So that was the first thing", said an unnamed source in the White House quoted in the book.
Wead’s book suggests that the Obama administration wasted a lot of time holding weekly “political correctness” meetings in the White House, but without positive results, according to Fox News.
