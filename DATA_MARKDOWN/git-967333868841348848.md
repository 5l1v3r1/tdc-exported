        The air raid comes days after Daesh* chief al-Baghdadi was allegedly killed in an overnight raid in Syria’s Idlib province, where some terrorists are trapped after losing most of the territory they once controlled.
      
French fighter jets have struck several Daesh targets in northeastern Iraq, France’s Defence Ministry announced in a statement on Friday.
The operation was conducted by Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft in cooperation with other members of the anti-terror international coalition.
Footage from inside a jet captured the moment of the raid.
