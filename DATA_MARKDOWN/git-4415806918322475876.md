The first televised election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn has been set for November 19.
The debate will be aired on ITV and it will be the first time the party leaders go head to head in the election campaign.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Mr Johnson to a debate earlier in the week, and on Friday said it was “welcome” that he accepted.
“This is a once in a generation election. So it’s welcome that Boris Johnson has accepted our challenge of a head to head TV debate. The choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson’s Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many,” Mr Corbyn tweeted on Friday.
