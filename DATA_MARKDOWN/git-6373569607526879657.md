Former promotion-winning Plymouth Argyle boss Derek Adams is back in football management - with the Pilgrims' League Two rivals Morecambe.
The 44-year-old takes over at Morecambe on a contract until the summer of 2022 after the long-serving Jim Bentley was lured away by ambitious National League club AFC Fylde.
Adams has been out of management since his dismissal by Argyle following a 5-1 drubbing at Accrington Stanley on April 27.
Morecambe are currently bottom of League Two, below Stevenage on goal difference so the task for Adams is obvious - to keep the Shrimps in the EFL.
The Shrimps are away to League One outfit Blackpool int he FA Cup first round on Saturday.
Adams will be at the match but caretaker bosses Kevin Ellison and Barry Roche will take charge of the team.
In the not too distant future is the prospect of Adams returning to Home Park with Morecambe on Saturday, December 14.
That is set to see the redeveloped Mayflower Grandstand open for a league game for the first time, albeit at 50 per cent of its' 5,403-seat capacity.
The return match will be at the Globe Arena on Saturday, March 14.
