Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is the sixth game in the series and, while Sega Sports R&D seemingly threw everything it had at elevating the formula, fans are stuck with an average entry that has always been more of a cross-branding experiment than a coherent franchise.
Here’s the setup: Mario and his friends — and enemies, of course — are in Tokyo for the Olympic Games, and Dr. Eggman and Bowser come up with the idea of trapping Mario and Sonic inside a retro video game console that will send them back to 1964, the last year that Tokyo hosted the games.
Those characters are then devolved back into their pixel-art form to compete in events that look like they were taken from an NES game, even through the NES wasn’t released until 1985. The system is called the Tokyo 64, because of the 1964 Tokyo Games and the Nintendo 64 ... get it?
