A woman named A Tju, 51, survived a direct collision with a wayward car, driven by a young woman identified by her initials FV, in Batam, Riau Islands on Saturday.
According to reports, at around 5:30am, A Tju was jogging in the Harbour Bay neighborhood. At the same time, a car driven by FV came in at a high speed from an adjacent road and hit a median strip, which caused it to leap into the air, hitting and knocking down A Tju, before it crashed into a tree.
A CCTV camera at the neighborhood caught the incident on tape, though we must warn you that the footage may be distressing to some.
