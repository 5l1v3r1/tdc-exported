Mobile network operator EE is no stranger when it comes to giving customers a cracking deal.

The EE website has a wide range of mobile phone deals on offer that come with a fantastic free gift including a Toshiba 4K TV or a Nintendo Switch games console.
The promotion is available on EE's Pay Monthly Deals , but limited-time offers are also available on EE's SIM-Only deals, Upgrade Deals, Pay-As-You-Go Deals and Broadband Deals.
