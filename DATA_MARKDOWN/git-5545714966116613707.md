BioWare is akin to a man caught in a torrential downpour without an umbrella, but with a big goofy smile plastered to his face because sunny days might be ahead. By the most lenient estimate, the rainstorm has lasted nearly three years; by harsher standards, it's more like eight years.
Through the decade, BioWare has suffered: Enormous blowback to the end of Shepard's arc in Mass Effect 3; a divisive reception to Dragon Age: Inquisition; the cancellation of Shadow Realms; a new Mass Effect that was so universally hated that it forced EA to put the series on indefinite hiatus; and an attempt at a Destiny-like games-as-a-service product in Anthem, which saw its player base plummet to depressingly low numbers mere months after launch.
