        "This guy, he will put himself in a really bad spot for me"
      
Matt Damon has revealed how Ben Affleck stopped him from getting beaten up while they were at high school together.
The pair have been friends for decades, and Damon spoke of how the friendship was solidified.
Damon was a guest on Conan O’Brien’s late night TV show last night (November 4) and recalled the last fight he’d been a part of, and that Affleck was the one who helped him out of it.
“I mouthed off to this kid that I knew, but he was like your height,” Damon said to Conan, “like six foot six, and I might have been 5’3 at the time, and I said something.
“I’d scored on him or something, and I don’t know, I said something but he came for me. And it was like this mountain of a guy came at me and I was like, ‘Oh man.’ So before I knew it, it was like I was on the ground, he was above me, and I was like, ‘This is gonna be bad.'”
