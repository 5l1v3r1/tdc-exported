Martin Keown has waded into the Dennis Bergkamp debate with a withering put-down.
Bergkamp became the subject of conversation when talkSPORT presenter Adrian Durham claimed the Dutchman was overrated.
Speaking on talkSPORT, Durham told his listeners: "If [Dennis] Bergkamp was that good, why didn't Arsenal win the Champions League, or back-to-back titles?
"He never scored 20 goals in a season in the Premier League for Arsenal. And he was there over 10 years. That's not good."
The controversial comments ruffled the feathers of a few listeners, including former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who felt obliged to hit back.
Taking to Twitter, Fabregas shared the segment from the radio show and wrote: "Is this guy serious? Lost the plot big time there."
"If you don't think Bergkamp was that good, then you don't understand this sport at all."
As you'd expect, a number of Gunners supporters praised Fabregas' response.
And it wasn't just fans of the north London either who liked or replied to the tweet, but an ex-player in the form of Keown.
Quote-tweeting Fabregas, the former Gunners centre-back wrote: "Who are we believing... one of the greatest midfielders of his generation or (you'll probably need to Google him) Adrian Durham?"
