Kenya TV stations have been airing their content on YouTube, live, for an extended period now. This has been beneficial to a lot of people, especially groups with access to unlimited internet. It is a simple solution that does not require a lot of components: you just need a smart TV or a dumb one with a streaming box like those that support platforms such as Android TV, Roku, Fire OS or Apple TV, to mention a few, to get access to such content without the need of an antenna that adds an annoying layer of friction when setting up your home entertainment system.
I have been using the same setup (smart TV with an Android TV Box (Xiaomi Mi Box 3)) for a while now because I have never been a fan of local TV â€“ but was satisfied with my arrangement because I could easily catch up with news or some explosive feature stories presented by some of our most talented journalists. This, however, has not been the case for the last couple of days or weeks because you can no longer access local TV live stream on YouTube, save for KTN News, and people have already noticed.
