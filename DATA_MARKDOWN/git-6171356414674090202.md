Google has just opened up crowdsourcing's potential to improve our lives by just a pinch more. In addition to fueling traffic speed and accident reports on Waze and Google Maps, the company is now experimenting with user-submitted data for a real-time public transit tracker app called Pigeon. It's been tested in New York City and is now headed out to six other U.S. cities.
Let's face it: if you live in America and need to ride a bus, train, subway, ferry, or another form of public transport, you're probably going to face a breakdown, delay or four of both by the time you've walked up to your stop.
While transit agencies have slowly adopted tools to speed up reporting with social media and text services, employees still need to spend precious time gather and disseminate reports from the public before blasting out updates â€” if they're understaffed, they may occasionally post a message after an incident has resolved itself. And even if you already use a tracking app, most of the data it relies on likely still comes from its participating agencies.
That's where Google's Area 120 project lab comes in: it started development on Pigeon for iOS last year to make alerts by riders for riders possible.
