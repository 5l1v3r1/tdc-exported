Vodafone's latest VeryMe Rewards offer gives you two adult cinema tickets for £7 every week at participating Vue venues.
The VeryMe Rewards scheme was introduced last year, and the latest offer is reminiscent of the two movie tickets for £7 at Odeon cinemas offer that was rolled out at launch. You can redeem two tickets every week which isn't too shabby at all.
Vodafone has also teased some upcoming offers you'll be able to take advantage of in the coming weeks, including 25 per cent off at Prezzo between November 11 and November 25, as well as 20,000 free Greggs festive bakes between November 12 and November 14.
Just log into your Vodafone app, click on VeryMe Rewards, and you're away.
