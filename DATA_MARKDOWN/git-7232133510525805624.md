For many of its earliest proponents, Bitcoin represents much more than an investment vehicle. For its most ardent supporters, the cryptocurrency has the potential to entirely dress the global balance of power.
One of its most vocal proponents over the years has been RT’s Max Keiser. The presenter believes that Bitcoin is now starting to be recognised as a potential threat to the planet’s existing power structure by some of those at the very top of the system.
On the latest edition of the RT segment Keiser Report, the presenter, along with co-host Stacy Herbert, discussed the growing “de-dollarisation” trend around the globe. NewsBTC has reported previously on efforts by Russia, China, and Europe to reduce their dependence on the US national currency for world trade.
