Billie Eilish was among the fans celebrating after alternative rock band My Chemical Romance announced they were reuniting.
The popular group had a dedicated following – especially among fans of the punk and emo genres – when they split up in 2013 after 12 years together.
On Thursday, they finally confirmed rumours they were getting back together for a reunion show in Los Angeles in December.
