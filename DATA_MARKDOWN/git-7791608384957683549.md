The term “OK Boomer” has found its place on the internet, even making its way into New Zealand’s Parliament this week—but those at the center of phrase, boomers, aren’t too happy about the reference. According to The New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz, teenagers use this phrase as a retaliation to “cringey YouTube videos, Donald Trump tweets, and basically any person over 30” who criticize younger generations and their beliefs. These concerns include climate change, political division and economic hardship that prevalently weigh on the minds of youths. Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick used the term to shut down a heckler during her speech on environmental change in New Zealand’s Parliament. The millennial slang failed to translate on television, and her words were quoted as, “OK, Berma.” So, if you don’t know, now you know. In short, Gen Zs are now disarming the boomers’ outcry of unsolicited condemnation, often masked as wisdom. Take a look at some Boomers’ replies, as well as some spoofed reactions, to the term “OK boomer.”
