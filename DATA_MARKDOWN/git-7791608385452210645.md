Image via Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Facebook recently announced that it has updated its logo for its corporate parent company in order for it to go with other products and services. The logo, which now reads as FACEBOOK in all-caps, has raised a couple of brows, with some social media users poking fun at the wordmark claiming that it reflects the baby boomer generation’s apparent tendency to “scream” in their posts. Among those who laughed at the new logo was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey doesn’t seem to be a big fan of the new branding and, in a tweet on Tuesday, decided to mock Facebook’s all-caps design. “Twitter from TWITTER,” Dorsey wrote. His tweet has drawn over 20,000 likes and inspired many Twitter users to send out similar jabs of their own.
