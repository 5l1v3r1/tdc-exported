England head coach Eddie Jones has refused to blame a delay to his side’s bus journey to Yokohama for their lacklustre display in the Rugby World Cup Final.
South Africa beat England 32-12 in the final at Yokohama International Stadium in a game in which England struggled to get a foothold.
The team’s official bus journey to the stadium was delayed by roughly a half an hour late, delaying England’s warm-up.
“The effort of the players was outstanding. We just weren’t good enough today. Congratulations South Africa on an outstanding performance,” Jones said immediately after the match. “Yeah, well we just struggled to get into the game, the effort of the players was outstanding but we just struggled to get on the front foot today.
“I can’t fault the preparation of players who have worked hard the entire World Cup, I think they played with a lot of pride and passion. We just weren’t good enough today and congratulations South Africa on an outstanding performance.”
“Japan’s put on a fantastic World Cup, it’s very well attended, the grounds have been terrific, the organisation’s first class so arigato gozaimasu (thank you very much).”
