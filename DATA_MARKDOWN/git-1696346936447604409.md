        A financial report circulating on social media platforms shows that CashApp’s bitcoin purchase volumes surged impressively in the third quarter of 2019. The data created impressive prospects for the emerging Bitcoin market. However, according to an independent analyst, the numbers were gloomy.
      
Friar Hass, who has a history of stalking and reporting CashApp’s financial quarters, noted that the application sold only 8.7 percent of the total produced bitcoins in Q3. Hass found the miners mined about 176,137.5 BTC spanning between Block Height 583,172 to 597,263. That pushed bitcoin’s total production value to $1.83 billion, out of which $159 million made to the CashApp platform, as read from the Square’s third-quarter investment letter.
