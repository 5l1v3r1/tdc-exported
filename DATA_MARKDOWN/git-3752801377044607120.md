A breakthrough into who is behind the desecration of at least 80 graves at Mowbray Muslim cemetery in Cape Town is close at hand after a neighbourhood watch received a tip-off and recovered some items from the graveyard. 
"We received some information from someone who lives the mountain," said Cedric Thomas, the spokesperson for U-Watch neighbourhood watch.
"We found a tombstone, we found pot plants, we found some of the railing that people put around the graves," Thomas told News24. 
He said they even found some of the special sheeting that the dead were swaddled in. 
The neighbourhood watch is still putting out feelers for more information about the incident. 
The discovery of the ripped out tombstones laid out in the shape of a cross and some shoved into open graves in the shape of triangles was made on Wednesday.
