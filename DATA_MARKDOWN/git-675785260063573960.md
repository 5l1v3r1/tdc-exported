Conor McGregor was full of praise for Katie Taylor after she became a two-weight world champion.
Taylor outpointerd Christina Linardatou in Manchester to win a super-lightweight belt having already won three titles at the weight below.
The Irishwomen was emotional after the result was announced and McGregor was quick to sing her praises.
He tweeted: "What a fighter KatieTaylor! Five-time world champion across two weight classes. Wow! #Inspiration."
Amidst her tears, Taylor said: "We knew this would be a very tough fight, I boxed smart for a change instead of getting stuck into a fight.
"I'm a two-weight world champion, I want that rematch with [Delfine] Persoon and the Amanda Serrano fight. The Cecilia Braekhus fight as well can be made."
Taylor was awarded the fight by scores of 96-94 and 97-93 twice but was made to work hard with her right eye closing throughout the bout.
She is now unbeaten in 15 fights and promoter Eddie Hearn plans to line up a stellar 2020.
"Congratulations to a true icon, everyone should be so proud of Katie," he said.
"She's just an absolute brilliant example of how hard work can get you to the very top.
"She's turned the sport on itâ€™s head.
"She will never duck for a challenge, 2020 will be huge, she will continue making history."
