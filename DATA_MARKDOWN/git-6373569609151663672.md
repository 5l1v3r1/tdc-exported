A fearsome-looking alligator was filmed casually climbing into an American air base - not long after the Royal Navy's mammoth aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth had left.
The gator was filmed scaling the fence and wandering inside by a woman as she drove past the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend.
British sailors had a lucky escape of sorts, having spent considerable amounts of time at the base in recent weeks.
Video footage shows the alligator easily climbing the perimeter fence before landing inside the base and strolling away.
Remarkably, US defence officials say they don't even intend to catch the animal - unless it starts to pose a threat to residents there.
