Cape Town - Get ready emo kids! Your favourite band is getting back together! 
After years and years of speculation, it has been confirmed My Chemical Romance will reunite for one show, at least, at the Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles. Speculation was at its highest earlier this year when Joe Jonas claimed My Chemical Romance had been rehearsing in the studio next door to the Jonas Brothers, which guitarist Frank Iero later denied.
The show - taking place on 20 December - will be the band's first since 2012. 
My Chemical Romance released their last album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys in 2010.
Tickets for the reunion gig go on sale Friday via AXS.
