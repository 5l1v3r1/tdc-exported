From her trash bin concert merchandise that was sold out 3x to her beige top that became unavailable soon after her video at the airport went viral, TWICE's Tzuyu is at it again as one of the items she used recently sells out fast.
Along with her TWICE co-member Jeongyeon, the Taiwanese beauty was spotted on October 31 at Louis Vuitton's 2020 Cruise Spin Off Show.
Seems like fans and other fashion enthusiasts who may have seen her photos during the event fancied the LV handbag she was using as it got sold out just a day after the fashion show.
TWICE's maknae is indeed staying true to what most ONCEs call her... a "sold out queen".
