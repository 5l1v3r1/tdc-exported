        New Delhi (Sputnik): In deeply traditional and conservative India, parents often seek partners for their children in marriage. It is rather unusual for children to seek partners for their widowed mothers or fathers, much less search for them publically.
      
One young girl has posted a proposal for a groom for her widowed mother on her Twitter handle, inviting many curious responses. Some lauded her liberal intentions, many posted memes and some even directly proposed.
The tweet contained her mother’s photograph with her and the description reads “Looking for a handsome 50 year-old-man for my mother! J Vegetarian, Non-Drinker, Well Established”
