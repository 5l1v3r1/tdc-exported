ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Angels have finalized new manager Joe Maddon’s coaching staff for the 2020 season, including the retention of hitting coach Jeremy Reed and the hiring of new pitching coach Mickey Callaway.
The Angels announced the full staff Wednesday.
Brian Butterfield will be the Angels’ third base coach. The veteran infield coach spent the past two seasons working under Maddon in the same job for the Chicago Cubs.
Former Cubs hitting coach John Mallee joins the Angels as an assistant hitting coach to Reed, who was Brad Ausmus’ hitting coach last season with the Angels.
Callaway was the New York Mets’ manager for the past two seasons.
Jesús Feliciano returns as the Angels’ first base coach. José Molina returns as catching coach.
