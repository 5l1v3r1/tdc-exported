Stewartry Community Sports Club held a tennis camp for under-10s during the school holidays.
There was an excellent turnout of 21 youngsters drawn from the host club as well as some from Dalbeattie and Kirkcudbright tennis clubs.
 
Club junior coach Mark Sindall, assisted by his daughter, took the group for three hours of fun drills, games and exercises.
Junior club coaching goes indoors at Castle Douglas High School on Thursdays with three groups – five to nine years, 10 and over and a Stewartry improvers group. Places are filling fast, contact Mark to book a place on marksindalltenniscoaching@gmail.com or 07833358881.
 
The club entered a team in the Dumfries and Galloway nine and under orange ball league which was played in a day at Annan Seaforth Tennis Club.

        The team of Eamon and Isla McFarlane won the competition after a number of hard fought singles and doubles matches against other clubs from the area.
