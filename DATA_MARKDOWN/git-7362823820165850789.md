A miniature horse drew big smiles on one of San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains this week.
Employees allowed the service animal to board the train Tuesday after its owner provided the proper paperwork, BART said in a statement.
"This mini horse is a service animal, and the owner provided paperwork to a station agent stating so," BART said. "After consultation (station agents usually don’t see horses), the horse was allowed in."

"Trained service animals assisting people [with] disabilities and on [a] leash are welcome on BART," the transportation system added.
