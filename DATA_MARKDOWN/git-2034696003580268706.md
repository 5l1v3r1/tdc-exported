FKA Twigs recently performed live at Maida Vale, where she sang a cover of ‘Summertime’, the jazz standard popularised by Billie Holiday, and songs from her upcoming album ‘Magdalene’.
Twigs kicked off the session – for Annie Mac and BBC Radio 1 – with a moving rendition of ‘Summertime’, a George Gershwin composition initially written for the opera Porgy & Bess.
She then performed ‘Magdalene’ singles ‘Home With You’ and ‘Cellophane’, accompanied by a pianist as well as small string and woodwind sections.
Twigs’ performance was followed by an interview with Annie Mac, where she opened up about her mental health. “It’s becoming apparent as I get older and as I get to know myself, it’s okay not to feel amazing all the time,” she said.
