Last week, Google Fi announced that it would be taking advantage of DSDS starting on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. In addition to the eSIM, a SIM is required and Google today is making Fi SIM cards available at Target.
Joining Best Buy earlier this year, new and current subscribers can walk into Target stores nationwide to get a “Google Fi SIM Card Kit.” It costs $9.99 — instead of free from Google directly — but it includes a $10 credit that will be applied on your first bill. These are not the data-only variants, providing both cellular and data connectivity.
The retail packaging is quite simple with the latest logo, Project-less name, and tagline: “A different kind of phone plan.” Target joins Best Buy stocking these kits back in February. It’s faster than having to wait a few days for free shipping from Fi if your device doesn’t support eSIM.
In September, Google announced a new “Unlimited” plan, which the Target listing makes reference to. Starting at $70, you get unlimited data but capped video. The original “Flexible” plan where you pay by the GB is still available.
