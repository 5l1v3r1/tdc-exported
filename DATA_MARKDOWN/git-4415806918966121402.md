Boeingâ€™s capsule for astronauts has undergone its first major flight test, shooting a mile into the air then parachuting back to the New Mexico desert.
The Starliner capsule carried no crew, just a test dummy for the one-and-a-half-minute test of the launch abort system.
Only two of the three main parachutes opened, but both Nasa and Boeing said astronauts would have been safe if aboard.
The abort system is designed to provide a fast getaway for a crew, if there is an emergency on the Florida pad or in flight.
