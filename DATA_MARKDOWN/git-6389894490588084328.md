Dominic Chappell, the businessman who bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for £1 a year before the company collapsed with 11,000 jobs lost, has been barred from serving as a company director for ten years.
Sky News reported today that the government’s insolvency service had handed the the three-time bankrupt the decade-long ban.
