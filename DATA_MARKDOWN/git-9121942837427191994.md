KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan official says the government hasn’t been officially informed of any security concerns that have prompted Pakistan to close its consular services in Kabul.
Pakistan’s Embassy in a statement announced the closure, citing unspecified security concerns. It says that consular services won’t be available from Monday on and until further information.
Islamabad has not disclosed any details on the security concerns but on Sunday, Pakistan’s foreign affairs ministry summoned the Afghan chargé d’affaires to convey concerns about the safety of its diplomats in Kabul.
Garan Miahen, spokesman for the Afghan foreign ministry, told The Associated Press on Monday that says authorities will investigate the issue.
Afghanistan and Pakistan have an uneasy relationship, with Kabul blaming Islamabad for supporting the Taliban in the country’s protracted war.
