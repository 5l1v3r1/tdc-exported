George Ford is at a loss to explain England’s inability to make a meaningful contest of Saturday’s World Cup final rout by South Africa.
A 32-12 defeat in Yokohama ended Japan 2019 in the most deflating way possible as Eddie Jones’ men failed to show up for a match they entered as favourites.
The Springboks savaged passive opponents who barely fired a shot, their mastery up-front matched by two brilliantly taken tries finished by wings Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe.
After the spectacular demolition of New Zealand in the semi-finals, English optimism was cruelly punctured and Ford echoed Jones’ admission that the reasons are baffling.
“South Africa were the better team on the day by a good distance. It’s massively disappointing,” Ford said.
