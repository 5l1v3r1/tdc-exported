Bollywood celebrities seem to be enjoying their rendezvous with the common man during their morning walks and vacays, stories of which are later shared on social media. First off it was Akshay Kumar who tweeted about his morning walk experience with his daughter Nitara. The actor spoke about an old couple’s random act of kindness, as they offered Akshay and his daughter the ‘most delicious gur-roti’. “Today’s morning walk turned into a life lesson for the little one. We walked into this kind, old couple’s house for a sip of water and they made us the most delicious gur-roti. Truly, being kind costs nothing but means everything,” posted Akshay.
