According to Reuters, Iraqi protesters have blocked the entrance to an oil refining facility in the city of Nasiriyah, which is located about 370Â kilometres (225 miles) southeast of Baghdad.
The agency reported, citing sources, that the blockage has already resulted in fuel shortages across Dhi Qar province.
