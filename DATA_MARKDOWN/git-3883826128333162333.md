        The Duchess of Cornwall has pulled out of a memorial event due to a chest infection, Clarence House has said.
      
She was due to visit Westminster Abbey's Field of Remembrance with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
A spokeswoman said Camilla was "told by her doctor" to cancel her engagements as the infection had got progressively worse over the last few days.
The duchess also missed an event on Wednesday due to the illness.
