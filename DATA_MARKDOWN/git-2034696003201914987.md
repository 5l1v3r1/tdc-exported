        “He was instrumental to the discovery that was taking place"
      
Lorde has penned an emotional letter to fans explaining that the timetable for her next album has shifted following the death of her dog Pearl.
The singer-songwriter, who has been busy working on the follow-up to her 2017 album ‘Melodrama’, sent the lengthy note to subscribers of her newsletter.
Starting by explaining why she hasn’t written to her fans much as of late, Lorde said: “When we first met I would write little notes for you online, and they would form a big map that you would use to chart the constellations in my work. I realized a couple of years ago that I needed to rethink my relationship with posting random shit online all the time, so here we are, a little less in contact than we once were.”
The singer, real name Ella Yelich-O’Connor, went on to explain that her dog Pearl, who she adopted in 2018, passed away last month after battling a series of illnesses. “Pearl had two cardiac arrests about an hour apart, and after the second one, he died,” she wrote. “I was holding him when he went, and I know he knew that I was there. But this loss has been indescribably painful, and a light that was turned on for me has gone out.”
