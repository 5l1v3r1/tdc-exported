Last Friday, emo heroes My Chemical Romance announced they would be reuniting on stage in December, their first show together in seven long years.
As far as Halloween surprises go, it was a pretty goddamn good one — frontman Gerard Way had previously brushed aside the idea of a reunion, and told The Guardian that making music with the band had “stopped feeling fun” prior to their split in 2013.
Clearly something changed his mind in the years since, as the band will land in Los Angeles for an (as yet) one-off show on December 20.
The reaction to the news was, ahem, rather intense — the memes in particular have been spectacular — and yesterday the band revealed that they were stunned by the outpouring of love they received following the announcement.
“It is truly unbelievable to us the happiness we have experienced over the past two days,” the band wrote on Instagram. “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for the warm welcome back. We truly did not expect this. See you soon.”
They weren’t the only band to announce their reunion over the weekend: Rage Against The Machine were announced as the headliners of Coachella 2020, along with a string of tour dates. Screw 2020, we’re going back to 2008.
