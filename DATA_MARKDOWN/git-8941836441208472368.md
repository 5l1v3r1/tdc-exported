        ANALYSIS/OPINION:
      
Democrats are trying to point out supposed double standards at play in the GOP by pointing out that the Republicans changed the rules during the Benghazi closed-door hearings — hence why the Democrats want closed-door impeachment hearings now. But you can’t compare the impeachment of a sitting president to the Benghazi closed-door hearings.
The impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had bipartisan support in the procedural votes. This time around, it’s partisan. Impeachment in the cases of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton was never about a partisan effort; both Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton had criminal charges against them before the impeachment. With Mr. Trump, there is no criminal case. Quid pro quo isn’t criminal, and I see no high crimes.
