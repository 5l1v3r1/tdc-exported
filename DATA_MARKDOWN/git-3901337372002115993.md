Taking time out of his hectic schedule, Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka this week visited The Football Factory, an academy owned by a former Chiefs star.
Maluleka & Co are gearing up for a tough midweek encounter against Chippa United. Before jetting out to Port Elizabeth, the midfielder paid a visit to some rising stars.
Former Amakhosi striker Stanton Lewis, along with his brother Steven, are honing the prospective talents of Mzansi, in hopes that one day they get to reach the heights of the likes of Maluleka.
