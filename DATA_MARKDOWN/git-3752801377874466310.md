As South Africans celebrate the Springboks third Rugby World Cup win, a tweet by EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has proved about as successful as the English scrum on Saturday.
Even before the game, Ndlozi was disparaging to the Springboks and their supporters.
"Aggg please, today is England vs. England. I mean during 2010 World Cup the settlers had both flags in their homes & cars. It's a win win for them because they are still England at heart! You should be focused on removing apartheid statues," he responded to a tweet by Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa wishing the Boks well.
