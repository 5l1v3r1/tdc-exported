Twitch has lost some big names lately as streamers sign exclusivity deals with other streaming sites. Tyler “Ninja” Blevins was the first to go, and now streams off Microsoft’s platform Mixer. He was followed to Mixer by Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek in late October. Now, professional streamer Jack “CouRage” Dunlop has signed a deal to exclusively stream on YouTube.
