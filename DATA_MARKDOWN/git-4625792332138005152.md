President Trump denied reporting yesterday by the Washington Post that he had asked Attorney General William Barr to hold a press conference to deny any wrongdoing in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
In a Thursday morning tweet, Trump chided the newspaper for not sourcing their story. "The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference," he said. "Never happened, and there were no sources!"
