FARMINGTON, MaineÂ (AP) - The condition of a building supervisor credited with getting people to safety before a deadly explosion in Maine has been upgraded from serious to fair.
Larry Lord was seriously hurt weeks ago in a propane explosion at LEAP Inc. in Farmington. The Sun Journal reports his condition was upgraded Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
The explosion killed Farmington fire Capt. Michael Bell and injured six other firefighters seriously or critically. The firefighters have since been released from the hospital.
Lord helped get almost a dozen people get out of the building and find safety before he called the fire department to report the smell of propane. The building exploded just minutes later.
The cause of the leak and explosion at Leap Inc. are still under investigation.
