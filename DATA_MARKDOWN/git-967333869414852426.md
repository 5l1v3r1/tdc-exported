Four years after NASA’s New Horizons probe performed its flyby study of Pluto, it appears that the US space agency now funded the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), which leads the mission, to perform a study on a possible orbiter mission to the dwarf planet.
According to phys.org, this undertaking is in fact merely one of the ten different studies sponsored by NASA in preparation for the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey.
As the media outlet points out, while the New Horizons supplied a wealth of information about Pluto, the spacecraft carries a “limited payload” and thus was unable to uncover certain aspects of the dwarf planet, and an orbiter mission could help fill these gaps.
The results of all of the aforementioned studies are expected to be delivered at the National Academy Planetary Decadal Study set to begin in 2020.
