Bitcoin’s price has been slowly inching higher after briefly visiting its range lows around $9,000 this past weekend, but in order for bulls to maintain their growing strength, it is imperative that they push BTC past its range high resistance level at $9,500.
Analysts are now noting that the bull case for Bitcoin may be growing stronger, as the crypto has begun finding strong support at a key technical level and has been incurring increasing on-chain volume – factors that could help push the crypto higher in the near-term.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up just under 1% at its current price of $9,375, which marks a slight climb from its daily lows of just under $9,300.
Bitcoin’s slow and steady climb over the past few days was first sparked when BTC fell towards $9,100 this past weekend, and it has been slowly climbing back towards its range highs at $9,500 in the time since.
How Bitcoin responds to its range highs in the near $9,500 in the near-term will offer investors and analysts alike significant insight into which direction the cryptocurrency will trend in the near-term, as a failure to decisively break above this level could spell trouble for which direction it trends in the near-term.
One factor that could aid Bitcoin’s bulls is the fact that the crypto has seen increasing trading volume over the past 24-hours despite there not being any major shift in price, which could mean that a big movement in imminent.
