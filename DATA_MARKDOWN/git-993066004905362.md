The Duchess of Cambridge has been embracing culottes. Structured styles in a longer length are best, with a slim-fit knit in a contrasting or tonal colour tucked in. Here are five culotte combos we love...

        1. Monsoon Tony Turtle Neck Top, £22; Carrie Smart Culottes, £39; Superga 901 Flatform Lace Up Trainers, £57
      

        2. M&Co Ribbed High Neck Top, £14; Sonder Studio Button Side Culottes, £35
      

        3. Roman Black Polo Neck Long Sleeve Top, £18; Amber Culotte Trousers With Pockets, £20 (were £30)
      

        4. Sosandar Camel Frill Shoulder Detail Jumper, £39; Black Gold Zip Detail Culottes, £45
