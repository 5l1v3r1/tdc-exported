BOROUGH PARK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police in Brooklyn are investigating a string of possible assaults in Borough Park, and while it's unclear if the incidents are related or motivated by hate, many in the area say it is indicative of increased violence.
The incidents mostly involved youths being chased by people in cars, including one case in which two people who were walking down the sidewalk were attacked -- one of them punched -- by a person who jumped out of a car at 14th Avenue and 48th Street.
"It's very scary," one resident said. "I don't even go out in Borough Park at night."
Other similar incidents are alleged to have happened at 14th Avenue at 51st Street and New Utrecht Avenue at 53rd Street, all three on Friday and all dealing another blow to the community.
"I just see it as an uptick of some kind of violence," another resident said. "I hope it's going to fade away quickly."
The neighborhood watch group The Borough Park Shomrim posted videos of the incidents.
