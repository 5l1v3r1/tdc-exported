        Bitcoin price slipped today as trade talks between the United States and China took a positive turn. According to reports, China may ease tariffs against US imports suggesting that a limited trade deal is in the works.
      
The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced Beijing and Washington had reached an agreement to lift tariffs between the two nations in stages, reported CNBC. The first phase of the agreement would be a series of simultaneous tariff cancellations between the two countries.
The positive development, however, coincided with a downturn in Bitcoin and crypto markets. Trade uncertainty actually helped boost BTC price with the top crypto-asset acting as a source of risk hedging and potentially a store of value.
