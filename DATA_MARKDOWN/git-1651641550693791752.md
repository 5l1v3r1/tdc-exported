WhatsApp has quietly added a new feature to the WhatsApp iOS app. With the latest update installed, WhatsApp for iOS users can now play Netflix trailer videos right from the app, meaning that if someone sends you a Netflix trailer link, all you need to do is click on the link and WhatsApp will start to play the video without taking you to the Netflix app.
The feature is not new though. WhatsApp can play videos from various other sources and that includes YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and now, aside from these services, Netflix trailer videos, too can be played in WhatsApp. Interestingly enough, we haven’t heard any official announcement from WhatsApp about the addition of Netflix to the list of supported services.
The feature is currently available only in the iOS counterpart of the WhatsApp, but WhatsApp is expected to bring the feature to the WhatsApp for Android in the coming days.
You can update WhatsApp from the below link, or you can head over to Apple App Store
