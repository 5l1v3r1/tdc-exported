Speaking to journalists before his departure for New York on Saturday, President Donald Trump said he would "certainly" invite Zelensky if the Ukrainian president wanted to come.
President Trump also said that more information would be released shortly about Alexander Vindman, the US official who told Congress he was concerned that Trump's call with Ukraine's leader threatened national security.
Vindman, a US Army lieutenant colonel and National Security Council official, has been targeted by Trump since his 29 October congressional testimony was released. Trump tweeted that day that Vindman was a "Never Trumper witness".
