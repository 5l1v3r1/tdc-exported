Word, PowerPoint and Excel for mobile are now a single Microsoft Office app. While the idea of it might sound a bit messy, Microsoft has found a number of ways to make your workflow run even more smoothly while saving memory space to boot. By bringing everything into one place, it “reduces the need to switch between multiple apps and significantly reduces the amount of space used on your phone compared to multiple installed apps,” the company explains in a blog post. Within the same app, you’ll be able to access recent or recommended documents, as well as look up files across your organization. The company re-envisioned the Office app as if it were first created for mobile devices, turning the use of your smartphone from a liability into an advantage. Most excitingly, you can now use your phone to transform pictures and physical documents into editable files. Using your phone’s camera, you can turn whiteboards at meetings as well as documents into images. Taking a photo of a document turns it into an editable Word file, while snapping a table turns it into a workable Excel spreadsheet.
