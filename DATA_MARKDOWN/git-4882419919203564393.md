A new experience for Pep Guardiola. The former Barcelona coach was left without a recognised goalkeeper at the San Siro on Wednesday following a string of unfortunate events.
Manchester City's first-choice stopper Ederson was taken off at halftime with an injury in the game against Atalanta. They will hope it's nothing serious with Premier League leaders Liverpool to come on Sunday.
Ex-Barça keeper Claudio Bravo took his place. However, with 10 minutes to go, the Chilean was sent off, leaving City goalkeeper-less.
Guardiola looked to his bench and turned to right-back Kyle Walker, who put on Bravo's shirt and came on in place of Riyad Mahrez as City ended the game with 10 men.
Walker's first involvement saw him save a free-kick and he managed not to concede while he was on as City clung on to a 1-1 draw in Italy.
