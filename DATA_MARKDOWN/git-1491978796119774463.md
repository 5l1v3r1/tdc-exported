        Despite the animal abuse scandal, plenty of punters still love a bet and the media loves the money that pours in from the industry
      
The Melbourne Cup is “in every sense a sacred occasion, unique to the Western world,” a commentator in the Australian wrote on Monday, the day before the big race.
The Daily Telegraph printed a 28-page lift-out but it was the Herald Sun, being the tabloid in the hometown of the Melbourne Cup, which devoted the most space in the lead up to the cup: 39 pages of racing and gambling pages on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 40 on Monday.
There is no shortage of hyperbole when it comes to the print media’s obsession with the horse racing industry’s two biggest events: the Melbourne Cup and in recent years, Sydney’s Everest. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age also embrace the events, but their coverage is more modest and their racing guides are a fraction the size of the Murdoch papers.
