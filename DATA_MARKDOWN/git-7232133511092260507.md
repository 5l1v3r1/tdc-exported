A lawyer who is believed to have laundered money associated with the OneCoin crypto scam is currently standing trial in New York. Mark Scott allegedly used offshore investment vehicles to take as much as $400 million out of the US on behalf of the company.
OneCoin is one of the largest examples of a cryptocurrency scam to date. Estimates put the total figure stolen from investors at more than $3 billion.
According to a report by BBC News, Mark Scott was arrested a little over a year ago for his involvement with OneCoin. The former partner at the law firm Locke Lord faces charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud for his apparent role in the OneCoin crypto scam. The defendant pleaded not guilty.
