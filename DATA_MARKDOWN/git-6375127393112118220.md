Identities of the slain rebels were not yet available as of press time.
According to Col. Alex Rillera, commander of the 202nd Infantry Brigade, elements of Philippine Army’s 1st Infantry Battalion were conducting  patrol operation in Barangay Abu Abu in the said province when they encountered the rebels.
A firefight immediately occurred and lasted for five minutes that resulted to the killing of the three rebels.
There was no reported casualty on the government side.
Rillera said the incident is the fourth time the troops clashed with the terrorists in the     area in a month.
“The fact that we have been continuously hitting them can be attributed to the cooperation of the populace who have been giving us information because they have grown tired of the NPAs’ extortion and terroristic activities in their localities”,  Rillera said.
He added that the prevailing high degree of trust between the people and the soldiers “substantiates  the military claim that the NPA terrorists no longer enjoy mass base support” brought about by the effective and efficient implementation of RTF ELCAC 4A in the delivery of basic services down to the grassroots.
