The Cleveland Browns have cut safety Jermaine Whitehead after he posted threatening messages on social media following the team's Sunday loss to the Denver Broncos.
Whitehead drew the ire of fans and critics on social media after he missed two big tackles during the game. One of those missed tackles resulted in the opposing player score a 75-yard touchdown. He then fired back at the criticism on Twitter after the game, which led to the team's decision to release him.
He tweeted, "Don't get shot at lil bitch ... can you whoop my ass.. f--- football... let me know when you need the address," after an unverified Twitter user disparaged his play on the field. Whitehead then responded to another user, taking him up on the opportunity to fight before calling that person a "cracker."
