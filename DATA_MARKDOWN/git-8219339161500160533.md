Ecobee has become a go-to smart thermostat choice for Apple customers with HomeKit support along with other great features like the ability to work with multiple room sensors, and much more. Now, Ecobee thermostatsÂ are becoming even smarter with new time of use, community energy savings, schedule recommender features, and more that come with the free Eco+ suite.
Ecobee shared in a press release that Eco+ previously rolled out to a limited group of customers and it was a big success in helping users customize their climate control and reduce their spending and carbon footprint with the help of machine learning.
Now the free Eco+ features are rolling out to all customers. The set of features can adjust climate control based on weather forecasts, occupancy patterns, humidity and electricity rates (time of use).
Look for the Eco+ notification in your Ecobee app to set up and customize the new suite of features.
Ecobee thermostats start around $170 and go up to $250 for the flagship model with integrated voice control (reviewed).
