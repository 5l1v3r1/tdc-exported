Alia Bhatt is currently soaring high in her career. After giving back to back hits, the actress will soon start with her next project with Sanjay Leela Bhansali.
The actress is currently holiday in Los Angeles with BFF Akanskha Ranjan. And according to the reports, Alia is also looking out for an international celebrity manager. As SLB's 'Gangubai Kathiawadi' is yet to start rolling, the actress along with her manager jetted off to LA where they are discussing with agents.
The report further added that Alia wants to keep a balance between Bollywood and Hollywood. Reportedly, the actress feels that it is the right time to explore more opportunities abroad.
Meanwhile, on the work front, she will be next seen in Ayan Mukerji's 'Brahmastra' co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan. The film has been slated for January 2020 release.
