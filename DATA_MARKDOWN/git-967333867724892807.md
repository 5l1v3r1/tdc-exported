        WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Newly obtained video footage shows that a shipment of US-made heavy weapons arrived in Yemen last week despite efforts by American lawmakers to prevent such arms transfers, CNN reported on Wednesday.
      
The footage shows an Oshkosh armoured vehicle and other US-made military hardware being unloaded from a ship under the cover of darkness in the early morning hours at the port in the southern city of Aden, CNN reported.
The vessel, identified as the Saudi-registered Bahri Hofuf, is known to have stopped at the Port City of Jeddah on September 17 before sailing on to Port Sudan the following day, the report said, citing port documents, tracking data, and whistleblower accounts.
