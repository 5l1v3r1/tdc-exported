Linkin Park‘s Mike Shinoda has released ‘Fine’, a new track that will feature in upcoming movie The Blackout – listen to it below.
Shinoda teased the release earlier in the week when he posted an image displaying the track’s release date (November 1) to social media. He followed it up the next day with a similar image but also including a snippet of the song and its title.
It was liberated in full after Shinoda posted the song’s artwork alongside the lyrics: “Tell all the children to lock those doors /  I’ve seen the smoke in the sky before / Gotta be up on my feet / When the morning comes ‘Cause this fight you can’t ignore / Everything is gonna be fine. “
