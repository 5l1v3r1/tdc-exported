KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) - Offshore powerboat racers Billy Mauff and Jay Muller have piloted WHM Motorsports to lead the Super Cat-class after the first of three competition days at the Race World Offshore Key West Championships in the Florida Keys.
Mauff, of East Setauket, New York, and Muller, of Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey, easily placed first, leading at Wednesday’s start and never looking back.
CR Racing, with Robert Unnerstall of Wentzville, Missouri, and Casey Boaz of Osage Beach, Missouri, leads the Super Stock class.
A dramatic two-boat accident occurred on the fifth lap of the Super Stock race. LPC and Team Allen Lawn Care landed upside-down between Turns 2 and 3.
Officials say several crew members were transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Racing is to continue Friday with finals on Sunday.
