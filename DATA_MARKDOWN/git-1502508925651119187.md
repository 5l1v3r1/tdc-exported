Delhi's air quality continues to suffer as SAFAR recorded the capital's overall air quality index at a 'severe' 425 on Friday morning. The air quality was a tad better on Thursday when the AQI stood at 410. Today marks the fourth day of consecutive drop in the city and the adjoining areas.
At 6:30 am. the city's overall air quality index (AQI) was 425, according to SAFAR India (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research). Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad too recorded "severe" overall air quality.
An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor, and 401-500 severe. Above 500 is a severe-plus emergency category.
The AQI of four places in and around Delhi has been provided in the table given below.
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said that the air quality was likely to improve today, but it would remain in severe to upper-end of very poor category.
