Both Concerned Citizens for the Center LEX and KFK Kentucky received over $5,000 in just four days after launching a GoFundMe page to protest President Trump’s visit to the area.
The page stated:
On Friday, the organizers announced they had reached their goal and said they would give out miniature “Baby Trumps” to the first 90 people who could verify their donation.
Since its conception inside a London pub in 2018, the blimp has become “synonymous with resistance to the American president,” according to a report by the Associated Press.

In July, the National Park Service granted a permit to the far-left activist group, Code Pink, to fly the balloon on the National Mall during the “Salute to America” celebration, according to Breitbart News.
Despite past shows of disapproval, over 10,000 people packed into BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Mississippi, Friday night to hear President Trump speak.
