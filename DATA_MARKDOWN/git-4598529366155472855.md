President Donald Trump’s second venture out to the public on Saturday night wasn’t much more successful than his first.
Trump and his two sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump attended UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York City with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Peter King (R-NY).
He was met with a deluge of boos from a large section of the audience.
