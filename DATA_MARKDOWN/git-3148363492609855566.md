The incident occurred between Greenwald and Augusto Nunes during the live radio show Pânico after The Intercept editor called out the reporter for accusing him and lawmaker husband David Miranda of not having enough time to raise their children. Nunes also called for Brazil’s Juvenile Court to investigate Greenwald and Miranda’s parenting.
