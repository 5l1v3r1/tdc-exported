Southern sensation and Indian movie star, Tamannaah Bhatia is our favourite when it comes to setting style goals. The diva's Instagram is proof of the fact that her fashion game is always on point. The blue-eyed beauty who's been making news for her recent sari looks just set the internet on fire with a princess look and we can't keep our eyes off her.
Tamannaah took to Instagram to post a series of photos of herself, slaying in a short eclectic multi-hued dress and that was enough to stir up the social media channel.
The stunner rocked a dress hand-painted by American artist Travis Black that was inspired by early 19th century paintings in seed catalogs.
The beautiful outfit is courtesy talented designer duo, Gauri and Nainika, and it won't be hard to say it's one of the most interesting dresses we have seen on an Indian actor this year.
Styled by Sukriti Grover, the actress accessorised her look with chunky gold hoops from Minerali Store and white and yellow pumps from Dune London.
