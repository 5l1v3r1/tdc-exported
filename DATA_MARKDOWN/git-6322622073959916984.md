TOKYO (Nov 5):SoftBank Corp CEO Ken Miyauchi said on Tuesday WeWork’s Japanese business can become profitable “in the near future”.
WeWork Japan, a joint venture between the office-space sharing startup, telco SoftBank Corp and its parent SoftBank Group Corp, is growing well with high occupancy rates, executives said at a news conference.
SoftBank Group was forced to bail out U.S-based WeWork after its IPO attempt flopped and is leading a restructuring at the money-losing firm.
