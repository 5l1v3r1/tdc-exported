Ariana Grande has penned a long message on Twitter about healing as she marks one year since she released her song Thank U, Next.
The US superstar, 26, said the past 12 months had been “productive, emotional, wild and yet … happy” and that she had learned a lot.
She told her 67 million followers on Twitter: “Happy birthday ‘thank u, next’.
“I can’t believe i’ve spent more time alone this year than i have in my life, i can’t believe how many sessions w my therapist i’ve had, how many times i’ve sung this song, how much i’ve learned and healed, how much i still have to learn and heal !”
