YUMA, Ariz. (AP) - Yuma police say a 3-tyear-old child who collected candy at two Halloween events reportedly became lethargic and other symptoms and that a piece of suspicious candy will be tested.
Police Sgt. Lori Franklin said Friday that police began investigating after the child was examined at a hospital Thursday night.
Franklin said the child displayed dilated pupils and “abnormal behavior” and that unwrapped candy resembling a type known to contain THC was found in a container used by the child to collect candy.
THC is a compound found in marijuana.
Police advised parents to examine their children’s candy to look for any unwrapped or red gummy items that resemble a fish.
