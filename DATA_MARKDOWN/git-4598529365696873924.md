President Trump wanted his Attorney General Bill Barr to hold a press conference following the release of the White House’s version of the call of Ukraine, and make a blanket declaration that Trump did not break the law on the infamous call, The Washington Post reported.
Barr ultimately declined to do so, but the Justice Department did release a written statement saying no campaign finance laws had been broken and “no further action was warranted.” According to people familiar with the matter who spoke to the Post, Trump still wishes Barr had held the exonerating news conference. In recent weeks he’s raised the issue with associates in private a few times.
Trump reportedly made the request, which traveled from White House officials to the Justice Department. The request was made around the same time the rough transcript of the Trump-Volodymyr Zelensky call was released.
Trump, for his part, denied the request was ever made.
