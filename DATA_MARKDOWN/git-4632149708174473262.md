THE FAKE After the picture of a girl collecting oil from diyas on Diwali night in Ayodhya became popular on Twitter, a Facebook post identified her as a Rohingya refugee who was photographed in Bangladesh two years ago. The post claims that the picture is staged and the girl was brought to Ayodhya as part of a conspiracy, only for spreading propaganda against the Diwali ‘Deepotsav’ organised by the UP government. SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH? The post is false and a closer look at both the pictures reveals that there is hardly any resemblance between the two girls.
