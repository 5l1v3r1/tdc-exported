ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - The Texas Rangers have declined 2020 contract options for relievers Shawn Kelley and Nate Jones, and newly acquired catcher Welington Castillo. They all became free agents.
Texas announced the moves Friday, a day after acquiring Castillo in a trade from the Chicago White Sox.
Castillo has an $8 million option and a $500,000 buyout. The 32-year-old catcher hit .209 over 72 games last season.
Kelley was 5-2 with 11 saves and a 4.94 ERA in 50 games, with two stints on the injured list. The 35-year-old Kelley had a $2.5 million option with a $250,000 buyout.
Jones, who has a $3.75 million club option with a $1.25 million buyout, was acquired in July from the White Sox while recovering from right forearm surgery. He had a 3.48 ERA in 13 relief appearances in Chicago before going on the injury list in April.
