The Citizens have endured a tough start to the 2019/2020 season as the club find themselves in 13th positon after nine games in the Absa Premiership.
McCarthy's last match in charge ended in a 1-0 loss to Maritzburg United, which extended the side's winless run to nine matches across all competitions.
