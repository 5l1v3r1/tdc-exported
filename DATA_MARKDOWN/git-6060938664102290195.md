ANTIGUA: The Indian eves may have lost their first ODI against the West Indies by a run, but star batswoman Harmanpreet Kaur, who is among the finest fielders in the women's game, won everyone's heart after coming up with a stunning catch in the contest.
Harmanrpreet took a one-handed stunner at the long-on boundary at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium to dismiss West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor.
When it seemed the ball would easily sail over the ropes for a six, which would have also resulted in a hundred for Taylor, Harmanpreet plucked the ball out of thin air with a brilliant jump timed to perfection.
