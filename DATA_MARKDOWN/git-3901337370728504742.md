Orlando Pirates have received a new nickname from fans on social media, following the comments of their enigmatic coach, Rulani Mokwena.
Kaizer Chiefs were famously dubbed ‘7de Laan’ by fans following their time spent lingering in 7th position on the Absa Premiership log.
It is now the turn of the archrivals Orlando Pirates, following Rulani Mokwena’s post-match comments in Saturday’s Telkom Knockout quarter-final Soweto Derby.
Speaking to the media after the game, the 34-year-old described his side’s playing style in the most unique way.
"There was a certain moments I was sitting on the bench and I looked at the pitch I thought I was Picasso looking at the Mona Lisa painting. I could just smile with admiration for these players," he said.
Following his comments, fans quickly flooded Twitter, calling the Soweto giants, Mona Lisa FC.
