BuzzFeed News reports that the CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, has announced that the company will be banning “party houses” and cracking down on “abusive host and guest conduct” following a fatal shooting at an Airbnb rental in Orinda, California, during a Halloween party.
Renters of the house in Orinda held a party with more than 100 guests despite the Airbnb host stating that parties are not permitted at the residence. During the party, five individuals were shot after gunfire broke out, the situation is still under investigation by the Contra Costa County Sherrif’s Office.
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky announced via Twitter that the company was taking a number of measures to prevent similar tragedies, such as a ban on “party houses” and the implementation of a system that would screen for and flag “high-risk reservations.”
