“I’m proud to call her my senator. I can’t wait to call her our president,” Pressley said of Warren in a video shared to Twitter. “You’ve all heard about the senator’s plans but here’s the thing: The plans are about power, who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it. For Elizabeth and for me, power belongs in the hands of the people.”
