Aston Martin sank to a loss in its third quarter as demand for its luxury cars dried up, it revealed today.
James Bond’s favourite car maker found little love from other buyers as it swung to a loss before tax of £13.5m in the three months to the end of September. That compared with a £3.1m profit this time last year.
It came as buyer demand stagnated, with revenue falling 11 per cent year on year to £250.1m.
Aston Martin only built 1,497 cars over the quarter, a 16 per cent fall from last year’s 1,776 units.
Net debt stood at £800m, up significantly from December 2018’s £560m but marginally down from £811m a year ago.
