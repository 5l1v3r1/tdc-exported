Whoa, wrong Bristol.
NFL Hall of Famer and current ESPN analyst Randy Moss nearly missed his Sunday morning meeting at the sports network's office in Bristol, Connecticut.
That's because Moss' flight landed in Bristol, Tennessee, WCYB reported.
Moss told his colleagues on ESPN's "Sunday NFL Countdown" he stopped to watch the final football game of his son's career, but figured he would make it back to Connecticut for his meetings, the television station reported.
