MADISON, Wis. - After setting records for the snowiest Halloween, the snowiest October, and the largest single snow event in October, eyes remain turned to the sky as yet another chance for wintry weather heads towards southern Wisconsin.
This time, precipitation should be much lighter with minimal impacts.
The time to watch is right around the evening commute. That's when a light rain snow mix will likely break out over the area.
