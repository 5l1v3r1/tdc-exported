Everis​, an NTT DATA company and one of Spain's largest managed service providers (MSP), had its computer systems encrypted today in a ransomware attack, just as it happened to Spain's largest radio station Cadena SER (Sociedad Española de Radiodifusión).
While the ransomware attacks were not yet publicly acknowledged by the company, the ransom note left on Everis' encrypted computers has already leaked and BleepingComputer can confirm that the MSP's data was infected using the BitPaymer ransomware.
After the attack began, Everis sent an internal notification saying that they "are suffering a massive virus attack on the Everis network. Please keep the PCs off."
"The network has been disconnected with clients and between offices. We will keep you updated. Please, send urgently the message directly to your teams and colleagues due to standard communication problems," Everis added.
