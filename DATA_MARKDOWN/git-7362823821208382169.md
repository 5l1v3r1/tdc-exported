At a rally on friendly turf in Kentucky Monday night, President Trump urged what he called an "angry majority" of voters to send a powerful "signal" to Democrats and the world by handing the GOP a big victory not only in Tuesday's gubernatorial race there, but also in the pivotal upcoming statewide elections in Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
Richard Nixon had his “silent majority" and Ronald Reagan had the “moral majority." The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally his "angry majority" at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry.
Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September.
Amid chants of "USA" at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Gov. Matt Bevin.
At one point, Trump reminded the audience that American special forces had just provided "the world's number-one terrorist a one-way ticket to hell," in a colorful reference to the now-dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
"The dog will be coming very shortly to the White House!" Trump remarked, shouting-out the elite canine that helped take down Baghdadi.
