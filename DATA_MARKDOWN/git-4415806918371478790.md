Super League newcomers Toronto Wolfpack have announced the signing of former All Black Sonny Bill Williams on a two-year contract.
The 34-year-old dual-code international will be officially unveiled at a press conference at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium next Thursday and join up with his new team-mates after a period of rest and recovery following the Rugby World Cup.
The eagerly-anticipated code switch, in a deal thought to be worth in excess of £5million, was described as a momentous signing by Toronto chairman Bob Hunter, who likened it to David Beckham’s move to Major League Soccer.
