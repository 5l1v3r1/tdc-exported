Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik on Tuesday appealed to protesting cops to resume duties after his colleagues ditched their uniform to stage protests against the recent violence against them by the city’s lawyers. Hundreds of policemen gathered near the police headquarters in Delhi and chanted slogans such as Police Commissioner Kaisa Ho, Kiran Bedi Jaisa Ho (How should be the Police Commissioner, like Kiran Bedi).” One placard read, “How’s the josh? Low sir?”
Elsewhere, family members of Delhi Police personnel also staged protests outside the India Gate. Addressing the agitating police personnel, Rajesh Khurana, Joint Commissioner of Police, said, “We spend double the time in the field, at police stations, doing our duty than what we spend with our families. There is no festival that we celebrate with our families, at our home.”
