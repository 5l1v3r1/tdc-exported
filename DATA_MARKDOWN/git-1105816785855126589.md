MADRID: Spain will host the COP25 climate summit in December, the UN said on Friday, after Chile abandoned plans to hold it due to deadly anti-government protests.
Some 25,000 delegates had been expected in Chile for COP 25, including teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.
“We are pleased to announce the COP Bureau has agreed that COP25 will take place from 2-13 December in Madrid,” United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa said on Twitter.
