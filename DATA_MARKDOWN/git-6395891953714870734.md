CLEVELANDÂ (AP) - Police say a man suspected in a shooting that killed three people in Cleveland has been arrested on a warrant charging him with aggravated murder.
Cleveland Municipal Court records show 25-year-old Kielonte Harris, of Cleveland, was charged in the Saturday shooting that killed two women and a man. Court records don't list an attorney for Harris.
Cleveland police say officers responding to reports of shots fired around 4 a.m. Saturday found a man and a 36-year-old woman dead at the scene. A 26-year-old woman who was also shot was taken to a hospital where she died.
Police had originally reported two men were found dead at the scene.
A police release says the three who died were attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.
