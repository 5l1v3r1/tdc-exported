US President Donald Trump has accused former vice president Joe Biden of major ethical lapses and criticised Mr Biden’s son for allegedly profiting from his father’s office.
But on Monday, Mr Trump used his Twitter feed to publicise a new book by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, telling his 66.5 million followers that they should “Go order it today!”
“My son, @DonaldJTrumpJr is coming out with a new book, ‘Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us’ – available tomorrow, November 5th!” Mr Trump tweeted, calling it a “great new book that I highly recommend for ALL to read”.
