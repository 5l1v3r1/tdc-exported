Last month, Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro X, an ARM-powered device running full Windows 10. Instead of using a generic Snapdragon processor, Microsoft partnered with Qualcomm to create a custom SQ1 chipset to power this device. Surface Pro X also features LTE connectivity. Despite being the thinnest Surface, it will offer great performance and visual experience through its virtually edge-to-edge 13” touchscreen. You can make Surface Pro X a full laptop with Surface Pro X Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen.
The new Surface Pro X will be available in following variants and you can order it from Amazon today.
You can also order Surface Pro X here from Microsoft Store. Check out the new Surface Pro X keyboard here for $139 and new Slim Pen here for $145.
