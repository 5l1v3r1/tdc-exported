SINGAPORE: Around 50 electric scooter riders gathered at a Meet-the-People session (MPS) in Ang Mo Kio on Wednesday (Nov 6) night to voice their frustration over the recently announced ban. 
The riders, many of whom were wearing green GrabFood delivery uniforms, were hoping to meet Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who helms the Teck Ghee ward. 
A few of them had arrived at 6pm even though the MPS at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 was only scheduled to start at 8pm.
