LONDON: A British musician who launched a public appeal after leaving his 310-year-old violin on a train was reunited with the undamaged instrument in a secretive meeting in a supermarket carpark.
Police told on Monday there would be no further action taken against the man who returned the violin, which is reportedly worth around £250,000 ($320,000).
“My violin is home safe and sound! Thanks for the overwhelming support,” the musician, Stephen Norris, tweeted at the weekend.
