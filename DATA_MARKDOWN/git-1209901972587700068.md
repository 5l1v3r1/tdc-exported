A number of protesters across the border locked themselves to a dock at the Port of Vancouver in Washington Tuesday morning, in order to stop a shipment for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from getting to B.C.
According to the Portland Rising Tide, five protesters from Oregon and Washington climbed onto the dock, supported by dozens of kayakers and other boats. An incoming cargo ship, believed to be carrying pipeline materials for the Trans Mountain pipeline, was unable to dock for several hours.
Video posted by the activists at about 10:30 a.m. showed local police officers attempting to detain those on the dock.
