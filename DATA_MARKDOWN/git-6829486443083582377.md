Good morning, Angels! Your fave international women of mystery will be back on the big screen when Charlie’s Angels hits cinemas on November 14. To celebrate the release, we’re giving away a whole bunch of group passes so you and your BFFs can see the flick together.
It is truly some of the best news of 2019 that absolute queen Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games, Pitch Perfect) is bringing Charlie’s Angels back, with Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the next generation of Angels.
