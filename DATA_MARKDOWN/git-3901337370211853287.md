After defender Kyle Walker was forced to stand in goal during Manchester City's UEFA Champions League clash against Atalanta on Wednesday, the Premier League giants are now facing a goalkeeper crisis.

Pep Guardiola's side were dealt a massive blow during their 1-1 draw with Atalanta on Wednesday night after first-choice shot-stopper Ederson was forced off with an injury at half-time.
Although the nature and extent of his injury has not yet been confirmed, the Brazil glovesman is a doubt for this weekend's potential title decider against Premier League rivals Liverpool.

City's woes were compounded when Ederson's replacement Claudio Bravo conceded just minutes after coming on before being sent off in the latter stages of the match.
Bravo's ejection from the proceedings saw defender Kyle Walker to stand in goal for the final 10 minutes of the match, and the Chilean goalkeeper will now miss both of Cityâ€™s remaining group stage matches.

Ederson adds to City's growing list of injured players, with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Leroy Sane, Rodri and David Silva all out of action, although the latter could return in time for Sunday's clash against the Res.
