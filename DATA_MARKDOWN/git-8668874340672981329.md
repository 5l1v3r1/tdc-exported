World Cup winners Damian de Allende and RG Snyman are reportedly set to sign for Irish province Munster, in what represents a major double-signing for Johann van Graan’s side.
De Allende was a key performer for South Africa as they landed a third World Cup title, scoring tries against both Japan and Wales, while his defensive work was also a major factor in the Springboks’ success.
Snyman was mainly used as an impact player, but still made his presence felt in Japan.
