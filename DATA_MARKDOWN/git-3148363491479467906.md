“Employers are keen to hire refugees, who often have a strong work ethic and are eager to work overtime,” Snyder wrote in the Wall Street Journal. He continued:
Snyder’s focus on employers’ demands allows him to slide past the growing pile of evidence that refugees and immigration force down the wages earned by American employees. The employees’ wages are forced down when imported workers prevent the creation of a tight labor market where employers must compete for workers by offering higher pay.
Partly because of the reduced refugee inflow, President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” economy has created the conditions for a tight labor market — and so is raising American’s wages, reducing poverty, and reducing economic inequality.
Trump’s economy is even raising Americans’ hourly productivity — and so their future wages — by forcing companies to invest in more labor-saving automation, robots, and software.
