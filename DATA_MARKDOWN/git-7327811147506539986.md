JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- Family, friends and a high school community gathered Monday to bid a final farewell to Aamir Griffin, the teen who was shot and killed last month while playing basketball with his friends in Queens.
The 14-year-old was not the target of the shooting, and his death has sparked calls for justice as police continue to search for his killer.
His funeral was held Monday morning at the Greater Allen Cathedral.
"He didn't deserve this, he was a good kid," friend Delissa Chamble said. "I know everybody is going to miss him."
Griffin's casket arrived in grand fashion, by horse-drawn carriage.
