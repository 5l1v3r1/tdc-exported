Syrian President Bashar Assad claimed that he appreciates President Trump because he’s a “transparent foe.”
During an interview with NBC, Assad called Trump the “best president,” despite not liking his policies.
“I’ll tell you he’s the best American president,” Assad said. “Why? Not because his policies are good, but because he’s the most transparent president.”
