Fans are continuing to speak up for group MONSTA X and calling for former member Wonho to return to the group following the recent drama surrounding the group. 
The hashtag #WeWinForMonstaX7 seems to be a part of a hashtag campaign used by Monbebes to bring about attention to the group and demand that Wonho rejoins after facing illegal drug use and juvenile detention allegations by former reality star Jung Da Eun.
