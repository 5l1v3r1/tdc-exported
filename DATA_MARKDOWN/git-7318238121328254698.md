Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected to replace the controversial John Bercow as Speaker of the House of Commons.
The 62-year-old member of the opposition Labour Party has said the Speaker must be independent and fair and has promised to work to unite parliament.
Hoyle received 325 votes in the fourth round of voting.
The MP received the most votes out of the seven candidates in both the first, second and third round of voting but did not receive a 50% majority. The candidates with the fewest votes were dropped from the contest.
