A man in Arizona dressed up in a Jesus costume, handing out bread to the homeless, has become instant internet gold.
In a video that has amassed millions of views on Twitter, the man, identified as Daniel Graham according to Fox 10 Phoenix, wears a white robe while riding down a street on a motorized skateboard made to look like he’s floating on a cloud straight out of heaven.
As he makes his way down the sidewalk, Graham, holding a loaf of bread, maneuvers toward a homeless man sitting on a cardboard box with a sign that read, “Food?”
