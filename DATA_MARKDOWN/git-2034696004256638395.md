        "Fuck MCR, I didn’t even wanna see them anyways"
      
Tickets went on sale for My Chemical Romance‘s reunion show tonight – and they sold out almost immediately.
After years of waiting, the emo icons announced their long rumoured reunion yesterday (October 31) following their split in 2013.
Aside from sharing news of their reunion, MCR also announced a show at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on Friday December 20, their first gig since 2012. Tickets went on sale at 12pm Pacific Time today (November 1) and sold out in a matter of minutes.
My Chemical Romance fans flocked to social media to share whether they had been successful or unsuccessful in bagging themselves tickets.
“man fuck mcr i didn’t even wanna see them anyways,” one emotional fan tweeted. Another wrote: “I did it guys . I GOT TICKETS #mcr I’m coming for u.”
