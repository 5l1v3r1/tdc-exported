Democratic 2020 presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., appeared to misunderstand a question about access to child care at an NAACP forum in Iowa on Saturday, launching into an answer about health care instead -- for more than two minutes.
“Senator, the average cost of child care in Iowa is $8,200 a year,” Des Moines NAACP President and moderator Kameron Middlebrooks said, according to a report. “How would you both increase the availability of high-quality care, why at the same time reducing the costs so providers could still have a livable wage?”
