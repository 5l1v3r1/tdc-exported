John Hoskins, 32, who was a coach at Knightdale High School in Knightdale, North Carolina, was caught at a bar yelling, “White power, Knightdale! I still love you n****s!” Hoskins was celebrating his team’s victory over Corinth Holders High School. The incident was captured on Instagram Live by a bystander. The video was later deleted from Instagram but not before it was reported to school administrators.
