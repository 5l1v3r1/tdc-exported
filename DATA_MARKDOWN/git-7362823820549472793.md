Several people suffered minor injuries when the ceiling in a London theater collapsed during a Wednesday performance of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman."
Police responded to the Piccadilly Theater in the city's West End area around 8 p.m. after part of the ceiling crashed down. More than 1,000 people evacuated the venue, the BBC reported.
