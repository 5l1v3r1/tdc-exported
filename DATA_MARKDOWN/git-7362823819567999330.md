The Washington Nationals hosted a watch party for fans during Game 7 of the World Series on Wednesday and several of them expressed their displeasure with President Trump — again.
Trump had already been booed by fans when he made his appearance at Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park earlier in the week and then when a political campaign ad appeared during the team’s watch party during Game 7, fans began to boo.
