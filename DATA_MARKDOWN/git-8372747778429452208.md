SANIBEL, Fla. -- A heads up if you're going to Sanibel on Wednesday or Thursday; FDOT workers will be working on the second span of the Sanibel causeway.
The good news is that it won't impact getting on or off the island Wednesday.
The workers will be on a barge underneath the bridge doing inspections on the span. That'll last from 10 a.m. until about 3p.m.
On Thursday, however, traffic could be slowed. Crews will be working on the first part of the bridge and will have to shut down a lane to get their work done.
That'll also be from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m.
