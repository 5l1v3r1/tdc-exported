A record 2,133 pounds of cocaine, valued at about $31 million, was seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the Port of Savannah last week, the department announced.
“Drug Trafficking Organizations are relentless in their attempts to smuggle drugs into the U.S.,” said Christopher Kennally, Area Port Director Savannah. “Through hard work, dedication and tireless efforts of Customs and Border Protection officers in Savannah, we will continue to hit back at the Drug Trafficking Organizations by intercepting their dangerous drugs at our ports of entry before they can harm our communities.”
