Niagara Parks, an agency of the government of Ontario, Canada, posted to social media on Friday a video showing the boat grounded in a new location. The agency said the boat, an iron dumping scow, got stuck after an incident on August 6, 1918, where the barge broke loose from a tugboat. It's the first time it's moved any appreciable distance for more than a century, according to the agency.
