In September, one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges Binance launched its U.S. arm, initially allowing U.S0. citizens to trade 13 cryptocurrency pairs across Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin cash (BCH), Binance Coin (BNB), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP, and the Tether stablecoin (USDT). Since the launch, only one month has passed, but Binance.US has already demonstrated incredible results: its daily trading volume has exceeded $15 million.
Besides, the U.S. arm of Binance has increased token listings from 7 to 24 tokens, which means that US citizens now have access to 40 trading pairs. Among the cryptos available are Bitcoin (BTC), BNB, Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT), Algorand (ALGO), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Binance USD (BUSD), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Dash (DASH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum Classic (ETC), IOTA (IOTA), Ravencoin (RVN), Stellar (XLM), Waves (WAVES), Zcash (ZEC), and 0x (ZRX). Recently, Binance.US added support for NEO (NEO) and ATOM (ATOM).
