        The Early Access stage of Minecraft Earth is currently building its way across the globe and, as of today, is officially available in the UK.
      
Along with the UK, Minecraft Earth Early Access is also available in Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Sweden, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland.
You can pick up Minecraft Earth on iOS here (if you’re in one of the above countries but can’t see it yet – don’t panic! Just check back later today) and on Android here.
