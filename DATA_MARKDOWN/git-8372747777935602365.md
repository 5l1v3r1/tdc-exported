HENDRY COUNTY, Fla. -- We are learning about two new Florida panther deaths in Southwest Florida last week.
Florida Fish and Wildlife say on Thursday they found the remains of a 3.5 year old male panther on State Road 29 near Felda. They say he died after being hit by a car.
And a 4-5 month old female panther was also found dead in Hendry County on Friday in an orange grove off Wainwright Road. Researchers are working to figure out how she died.
Additionally, a Florida panther was found dead in Martin County on Saturday, killed by a vehicle collision. It was found along Beeline Highway, two miles south of Indiantown.
That bring the total panther deaths in 2019 so far to 23. All but five of those were vehicle-related.
