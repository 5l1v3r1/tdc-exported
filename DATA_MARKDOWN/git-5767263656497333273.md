Even dog people sometimes go “aww” when looking at a tiny clumsy kitten. Not to mention cat owners who usually go crazy about their pets. Sometimes the level of madness is so high that they don’t even notice the obvious, strange things in the behavior of their pets: all those unnatural poses, the way they stare at you, and the eyes that have a fire burning in them.
We at Bright Side came across some evidence that cats are not always nice and fluffy. It seems some of them are trying to hide their dark side in vain.
Do your cats behave in a strange way too? We would be glad to hear from you in the comments!
