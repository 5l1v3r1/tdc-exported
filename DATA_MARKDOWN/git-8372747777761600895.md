LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Jorge Guerrero-Torres is scheduled to be in a Lee County courtroom Monday for a case management conference.
He is accused of killing nine-year-old Diana Alvarez.
He's pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and kidnapping charges.
But Guerrero-Torres has already been found guilty on federal child pornography charges for having pictures of Diana on his phone, and is serving 40 years.
Diana vanished from her Bonita Springs home in 2016. Her body has not been found.
