Chelsea’s impressive run of form came to an abrupt halt on Wednesday night.
But Frank Lampard’s men have still won seven of their last eight - and can extend that record at Watford.
The youthful revolution at Stamford Bridge is going from strength to strength and they are clear favourites to come out on top at Vicarage Road.
Watford have had a torrid time this season and despite changing the manager after only a handful of games, they remain rooted to the bottom of the table.
