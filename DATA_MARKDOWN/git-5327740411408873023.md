The Surrey Eagles’ home game this Sunday afternoon will be played in support of the Paul Bennett Foundation.
Players on the BCHL team will wear special Cloverdale Minor Hockey Association-themed jerseys during the 4 p.m. game against Langley Rivermen, and the jerseys will be auctioned off after the game.
All proceeds will go to support the foundation created in honour of Bennett, a Cloverdale resident who was shot and killed outside his 67A Avenue home on June 23, 2018, in what police consider a case of mistaken identity. His killer is still on the loose.
Bennett, a married father of two, was an operating-room nurse department manager at Peace Arch Hospital. In his spare time, he coached and played hockey.
