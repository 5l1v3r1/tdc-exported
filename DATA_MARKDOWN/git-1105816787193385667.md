The personal physician of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif – Dr Adnan – has again raised alarm over the PML-N’s supremo’s deteriorating health and said the platelet count has dropped again to 38,000.
The doctor added that the platelet count drop was witnessed after doctors tried to reduce administered steroid dose.
“Former PM Nawaz Sharif remains critical,” Dr Khan tweeted. “The treating doctors tried to reduce the Steroids dose being given to him but unfortunately resulted in a drop in platelet count again which has come down to 38*10^3/uL yesterday.”
He also added that severe existent co-morbidities (IHD, ECVD, DM, HTN, CKD3) has added to the seriousness of the nature of the critical illness.
