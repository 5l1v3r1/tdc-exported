Google today announced the App Defense Alliance to “stop bad apps before they reach users’ devices.” This partnership sees the Play Store integrate third-party protections from ESET, Lookout, and Zimperium.
While user-facing measures like Play Protect work to scan and identify apps after they’re on your device, the App Defense Alliance wants to stop potentially harmful applications (PHAs) before they are published on Google Play and can even affect users. Other goals include reducing the “risk of app-based malware, identifying new threats, and protecting our users.”
This second “vital set of eyes” sees ESET, Lookout, and Zimperium partner with Google. They were “hand-picked” for their “successes in finding potential threats and their dedication to improving the ecosystem.” ADA members can request scans from the Google Play Protect scanner service, while Google can do the same to get results from partner scanning engines.
According to Google, this “secure two-way communication” results in an “open and collaborative atmosphere for partners and users,” and of course early detection.
