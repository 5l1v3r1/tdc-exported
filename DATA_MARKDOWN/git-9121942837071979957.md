WASHINGTON (AP) — Politics can be a bruising business. But President Donald Trump plans to get a firsthand look at a different kind of blood sport on Saturday night.
Trump is set to return to his hometown of New York City to attend a high-profile UFC match at Madison Square Garden.
Trump has long been tight with Dana White, the UFC president. The pay-per-view spectacle is expected to draw several celebrities, including wrestler-turned-actor The Rock.
It’ll be Trump’s second sporting event in a week, and it’s an open question how he’ll be received.
The president was loudly booed days while attending a World Series game in Washington last Sunday.
Trump’s departure from New York on Sunday is expected to further snarl traffic during the city’s annual marathon.
