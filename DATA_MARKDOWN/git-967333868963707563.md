        Writing in The Telegraph as he officially launches the Conservatives’ general election campaign, Mr Johnson says Brexit will unlock “hundreds of billions” of investment into the UK, but Labour would deliver nothing but further delay which would “hold the country back”.
      
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has launched a vicious attack on Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn in an op-ed for The Daily Telegraph.
Johnson went on to slam Corbyn’s proposal for “yet another” referendum on the UK’s EU membership, which he claimed would result in “another year of misery, and chaos and uncertainty for businesses and for families”.
The Prime Minister also took aim at MPs for producing a “paralysed parliament” in a video message recorded while en route to Buckingham Palace for a “tough” meeting with the Queen.
