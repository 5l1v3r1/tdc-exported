Protesters have vandalised the Hong Kong office of China’s official Xinhua news agency for the first time in months of anti-government demonstrations, smashing windows and doors.
Local media showed scenes of a fire in the lobby of Xinhua’s office in Wan Chai district, broken windows and graffiti sprayed on a wall. It was unclear if there were people in the building.
Protesters have been targeting Chinese banks and businesses perceived to have links with Beijing as anger grows over what protesters say are infringments on freedoms guaranteed when Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Police fired teargas rounds and used a water cannon to break up a rally on Saturday after some protesters threw petrol bombs at them.
