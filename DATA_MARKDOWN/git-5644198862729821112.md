LONDON: British MPs voted on Monday (Nov 4) for Labour lawmaker Lindsay Hoyle to be the next speaker of Britain's parliament, replacing John Bercow, who has played a key and controversial role in the Brexit saga.
Hoyle - a Labour MP for 22 years and Bercow's deputy since 2010 - beat out six other contenders for the role, winning the support of 325 of the 540 MPs present for a fourth and final round of voting in the House of Commons.
