Director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Christopher Wray testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee at a hearing on security threats facing the United States.
On Nov. 5, during the hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs, senators asked leaders from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center questions on topics including counterterrorism efforts, foreign influence in elections, cybersecurity measures, border security, and of course, cryptocurrencies.
Former Presidential Candidate and Republican Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, asked the intelligence officers whether the U.S. should not take some kind of effort in dealing with cryptocurrencies and its challenges they present to law enforcement’s anti-terrorist activities. He said:
FBI Director Wray took the lead in answering the question, saying that cryptocurrencies already present a problem for the agency. He stated:
Wray concluded his answer by saying that the FBI is already keeping an eye on cryptocurrencies, using “tools that we have to try to follow the money.” The FBI director also said that if the U.S. doesn’t keep up with new technologies, it will soon find itself being “walled off.”
Yesterday, during a counter-terror conference in Melbourne, the Australian Minister of Home Affairs Peter Dutton warned that terrorists are exploiting cryptocurrencies to “fund their deadly missions.” Dutton said that the anonymity of cryptocurrencies allows extremists to avoid scrutiny and that the increased use of digital currencies, stored-value cards, online payment systems and crowd-funding platforms may provide new channels through which to finance terrorism.
