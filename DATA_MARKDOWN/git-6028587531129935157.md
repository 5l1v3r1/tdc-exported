Topline: A proposed Trump Administration rule would no longer require government funded faith-based organizations to comply with an Obama-era rule that prevented discrimination against LGBTQ people.
Chief critic: LGBT advocates said the rule would permit discrimination and leave vulnerable communities without access to potentially life-saving programs.
“It is unconscionable that the Trump-Pence administration would prioritize advancing discrimination over the wellbeing of vulnerable people and expect taxpayers to foot the bill for their discriminatory policies,” Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a statement.
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement that “enabling providers of life-saving services to worsen these crises by rejecting transgender people is a moral crime and a severe abdication of HHS’s mission to preserve public health.”
Key background: The Trump administration has been criticized for rolling back LGBT protections before, particularly after it argued earlier this month at the Supreme Court that employers should be able to fire workers based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. And in 2017, the Trump administration sparked intense backlash after it imposed a rule that banned transgender people from serving in the military.

What’s next: The rule is subject to a 30 day public comment period after it is posted in the Federal Register.
