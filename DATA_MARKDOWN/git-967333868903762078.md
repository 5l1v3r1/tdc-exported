        MOSCOW (Sputnik) – The Under Armour sportswear manufacturer is defending its accounting practices amid an investigation launched by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      
Earlier on Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that a federal investigation, which has not been made public, is being conducted to figure out whether the company could have shifted its sales from quarter to quarter to mask its slowing growth and appear "healthier."
The sportswear manufacturer has seen multiple leadership changes in the past three years amid declining sales.
