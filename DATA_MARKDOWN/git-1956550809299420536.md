Emirates Airline Dubai Jazz Festival presented by Mastercard is back with a bang for another massive weekend of world-class live music – and the first artist to be headlining the weekend has been announced.The winner of Time Out Dubai’s Best Festival at the Time Out Dubai Music & Nightlife Awards 2019, the ostensibly jazz-originated festival is back for its 18th edition at the end of February 2020.It may play fairly fast and loose with the use of the term “jazz” nowadays, but the event has a long, rich history of putting on the biggest and best names from the world of music for three days every year.Last year saw ’80s rock heroes Duran Duran, funk rock legends Jamiroquai and Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter Alicia Keys take to the stage in Dubai Media City Amphitheatre, featuring support from some outstanding global and local artists, including local three-piece indie outfit Vandalye.Now, it’s been announced that former Fugee, and one of the greatest voices of the last 30 years, Lauryn Hill will be performing live in Dubai on Wednesday February 26. Expect hits from the Fugees era, like Killing Me Softly With His Song, plus tracks from her titanic 1998 album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, including this absolute classic.
