President Trump offered U.S. military support to Mexico after a Mormon family with U.S. citizenship was massacred.
At least six American children and three women were killed when they were ambushed in northern Mexico on Monday, members of the LeBarón family said.
Trump tweeted Tuesday that the family “got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other.”
“If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted.
“This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!” he said.
