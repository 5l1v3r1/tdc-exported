        Daniil Kvyat has admitted his frustration at being given a five-second time penalty for his collision with Sergio Perez, which ultimately cost him points at the United States Grand Prix.
      
Kvyat was on for a points finish until he was given a five-second time penalty which dropped him down to 12th place. It is the second race in a row that the Russian has been penalised for a move late in the race, having been punished for colliding with Nico Hulkenberg at the Mexican Grand Prix.
The former Red Bull driver admitted he was very disappointed with the outcome and feels it isn't good for the sport.
“It was a tricky race, we were a little bit off the pace today compared to our direct competitors," Kvyat said.

        "We used the tyres a bit more than we usually do, so we need to analyse that. Even with those issues, I managed to finish P10 on track on the last lap.
      

        "I think was a harsh but fair move, it was great racing like we want to see and what we have seen this season without other drivers being penalised.
      

        "I’m very upset and disappointed about this penalty because I don’t think this is what our sport needs.”
