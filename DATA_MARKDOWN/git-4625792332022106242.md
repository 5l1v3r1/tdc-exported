Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney expressed his condolences and called for the United States to work with Mexico after a Mexican drug cartel killed nine members of a U.S. Mormon family living in Mexico.
A caravan of U.S. citizens in northern Mexico came under attack by members of a cartel on Monday morning leading to those deaths and several others who were injured in the shooting.
Romney, who was born to American parents living in Mormon colonies in Mexico, said on Twitter, "Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico. Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence."
