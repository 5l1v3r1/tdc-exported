After delighting first-gen Pixel owners with an update to Android 10 — a one-year extension beyond Google's original two-year promise — the company is cooking up another surprise for the OG Pixels. Initially thought to have reached the end of the road in terms of security patches at the closing of October, the original Pixels will receive one final OTA update in December that will include improvements from November and December.
In response to a query about update availability, a Google spokesperson offered Android Police the following statement:
Google's support of its older hardware doesn't extend as long as Apple's, as many people wish for, but compared to all the other Android OEMs, the company's commitment is nevertheless commendable. Now if only more manufacturers would follow suit and emulate Google's behavior.
