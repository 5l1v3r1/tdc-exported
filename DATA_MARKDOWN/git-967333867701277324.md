        New Delhi (Sputnik): Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had earlier this month said Indians visiting the historic Kartarpur Gurudwara would not be required to carry passports. The 4.5 kilometers trans-border corridor links two important holy sites connected to the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.
      
Pakistan military spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor, however, made it clear that not a single Indian would be able to cross the border to visit Kartarpur Gurudwara in Narowal without a legal entry permit or passport. Citing security reasons for the summersault, Ghafoor said Islamabad would not grant any leniency towards those using the agreed corridor.
