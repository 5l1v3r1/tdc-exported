DORAL, Fla. (AP) - Authorities say a small plane has crashed in the middle of a Florida street, hitting a delivery truck.
A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration says the plane crashed east of Miami in Doral around 9:35 p.m. Sunday. The location provided in the statement indicates the crash happened near an industrial park and several small lakes.
It’s unclear how many people were aboard and whether anyone in the plane or on the ground was injured.
The plane was a Beechcraft BE-76, also known as a Beechcraft Duchess. Websites for flight schools that have the same type of plane in their fleets say the twin-engine plane can seat four people.
