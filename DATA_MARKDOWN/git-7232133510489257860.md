Ethereum (ETH) hasn’t done too hot over recent months. Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) started rallying earlier this year, altcoins across the board have suffered, falling against the market leader.
However, ETH is purportedly in the thick of a buy zone. Simultaneously, a number of analysts have claimed that the second-largest cryptocurrency is ready to head higher in the coming weeks and months. This confluence may present a solid buying opportunity.
If you’ve followed financial markets at all, you know that the 200-day moving average is important. This level, according to analysts across industries and time, is indicative of an asset’s trend. And according to a new analyst, it may be a viable way to determine when it is time to buy a cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin trader BitDealer recently noted that ETH is likely in a medium-term to long-term buying zone when it is 10 points below its 200-day moving average. Right now, Ethereum is in that zone, trading at $181.2 — some $30 lower than the technical level, which currently sits at $213.0.
