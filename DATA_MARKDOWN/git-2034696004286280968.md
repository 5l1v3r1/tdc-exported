Coldplay gave viewers a debut performance of ‘Everyday Life’, the title track from their new album, on Saturday Night Live last night (November 2).
Last month, the band confirmed that they’ll release the double album on November 22 – split into two halves called ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Sunset’ respectively. The first two tracks to arrive from the album were ‘Orphans’ and ‘Arabesque’.
