I have to admit that since the release of Call of Duty Modern Warfare last month, the game has successfully been able to drag me back into the franchise for the first time in 10 years. Not that Iâ€™m complaining.
While playing with friends (both on PC and console) has been a genuinely fun experience, what has perhaps surprised me the most (particularly in this modern gaming world) is that this launched in a very solid state. Yes, there are problems, but truthfully not many of them.
If you are, however, planning on jumping in for some Call of Duty action on your PC today, then you might want to get your Battle.net launcher open now. A huge 8GB patch has arrived to look to fix some of the little problems lurking within Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
