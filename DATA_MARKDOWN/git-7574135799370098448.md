Halloween celebrations have been extended a few days in Los Angeles as Goth icons Bauhaus played their first show in 13 years on Sunday night at the Palladium. Anticipation was electric for their return — a line stretched around the block before doors, a queue that only rivaled that to the merch table — and fans came out dressed to the nines. The band did not disappoint, and you wouldn’t know that frontman Peter Murphy had suffered a heart attack a little over two months ago, watching him prowl around the stage, belting out their many classics, including “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” “In the Flat Field,” “She’s in Parties,” “Swing the Heartache,” “Stigmata Martyr,” and “Dark Entries.” The rest of the band, bassist David J, drummer Kevin Haskins and guitarist Daniel Ash, were in fine form as well. They dug out a couple old gems, too: according to Setlist.fm, they played “Man with the X-Ray Eyes” for the first time since 1982, and “Spy in the Cab” for the first time since 1983. For the encore, they finished the night with covers: Iggy Pop’s “Sister Midnight,” and then their classic versions of T-Rex’s “Telegram Sam” and Bowie’s “Ziggy Stardust.”
Opening the night were Automatic, the new L.A. trio featuring Kevin Haskins’ daughter, Lola Dompé, on drums. Pictures of the whole night are in the gallery above, and Bauhaus’ setlist and a few videos are below. Bauhaus and Automatic play the Palladium again tonight (11/4), and they’ll be back for a third reunion show there on December 1.
