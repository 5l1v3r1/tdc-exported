Last week at Nintendo's financial results briefing, president Shuntaro Furukawa promised the company would "continue to enhance" Switch online content, to encourage more users to try out the service.
While it's taken a while to get going, it has improved in recent times with the launch of the Super Nintendo digital library. One other incentive to grab a Switch Online sub is so you can download free Super Smash Bros. Ultimate packs, containing some helpful in-game items.
The latest offer is a Vault Shopper Set â€“ which comes with 5,000 Gold and three Classic Tickets. You can get extra music, Mii Costumes with this pack. Once again, you'll need an online sub to be able to download this for free from the Switch eShop.

        So, what are you waiting for? Go and grab it!
