        England prop Kyle Sinckler was taken off with concussion in the third minute of the Rugby World Cup final against South Africa.
      
The 26-year-old collided with team-mate Maro Itoje, trying to tackle Makazole Mapimpi, and immediately hit the floor.
There was a lengthy stoppage as Sinckler was assessed by the on-duty doctor, before he regained consciousness and walked off the field.
The Harlequins front-row was replaced by 32-year-old Dan Cole.
South African hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi was also taken off for a head injury assessment after being replaced by Malcolm Marx in the first half.

Sinckler's a runner, key to those pivot plays England use. Dan Cole is a good tight-head but not as nimble.
You think in an hour, with the pressure he'll be under, he's going to be drained.
