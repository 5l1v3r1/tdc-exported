Scalise pointed to “impeachment inquiry procedures” laid out in a House resolution giving Schiff the ability to reject witnesses proposed by the Republican minority.
“There are sections of the resolution that allow the [Adam Schiff] to literally have veto power over Republican witnesses,” Scalise noted. “There’s a section in the resolution that allows the chairman to literally kick the president’s legal counsel out of the room out of the room if he so chooses, not because there has been some wrong that was done, [but] just because, all at the whim of the chairman.”
