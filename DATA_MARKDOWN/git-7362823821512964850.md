Prosecutors on Wednesday charged a white Milwaukee man with a hate crime for allegedly throwing acid on a Hispanic man's face last week.
Clifton Blackwell, 61, was already facing a charge of first-degree reckless injury. The authorities added hate crime and dangerous-weapon charges that could increase his sentence if he's convicted.
The victim, Mahud Villalaz, a 42-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Peru, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant on Friday and confronted him about parking too close to a bus stop, charging documents say.
Prosecutors said Blackwell asked, "Why did you invade my country?" and, "Why don't you respect my laws?"
Villalaz said he moved his car but Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him "illegal" and telling him to "go back, go back.”
Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist. After telling Blackwell "everyone comes from somewhere first," Blackwell allegedly threw acid on him, Villalaz said.
