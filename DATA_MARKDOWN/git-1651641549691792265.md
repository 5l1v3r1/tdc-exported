Two new zero-day exploits for the current stable version of the Google Chrome browser, one of which is already being used in the wild has been reported by the National Cyber Security service.
CVE-2019-13720 and CVE-2019-13721 describe two memory corruption exploits which would allow execution of arbitrary code by hackers.
Kaspersky notes:
The first affects Chromeâ€™s audio stack and the other the PDFium library, used for PDF document generation and rendering. Kaspersky researchers Anton Ivanov and Alexey Kulaev have confirmed that the audio hack is already being used in the wild.
Google has released an urgent patch, which updates the Chrome browser to 78.0.3904.87. To see if you have the latest version go to Help -> About Google Chrome in the browser menu. If you do not have it installed this is also a way to prompt Google to download the update.
