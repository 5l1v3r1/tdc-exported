        Earlier, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said that the United States was his country's 'ally number one'. The United States recognise self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido as Venezuelaâ€™s leader despite his failure to take control of the country from President Nicolas Maduro, whom the US has repeatedly called upon to step down.
      
The government of El Salvador gave Venezuela's diplomats accredited in this Central American nation 48 hours to leave the country, snubbing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The note explains that the decision was made in accordance with the Salvadoran vote in the Organisation of American States (OAS), which supports a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemning alleged violations of the human rights of Venezuelans.
