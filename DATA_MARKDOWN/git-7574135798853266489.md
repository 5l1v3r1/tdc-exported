Best Coast have announced a new album, Always Tomorrow, due in early 2020, and they shared lead single “For The First Time.” It’s a dose of glistening, dreamy guitar pop and you can hear it and watch the Kevin Hayes-directed video below. Best Coast also announced a 2020 tour with support from Mannequin Pussy.
The tour includes a NYC show at Brooklyn Steel on March 18. Tickets for that show (and the whole tour) go on sale Friday (11/8). All dates are listed below.
Before the tour, Mannequin Pussy will play The Front Bottoms’ Champagne Jam holiday show in Philly. Their great new album Patience came out on Epitaph earlier this year.
