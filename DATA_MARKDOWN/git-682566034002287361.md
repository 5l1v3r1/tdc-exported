McCarthy was in charge of the Mother City outfit for almost three seasons, but was shown the door on Monday after the club went through a disastrous spell with two wins from their last 18 games.
"This is a difficult time for me when it comes to Benni," Comitis revealed to KickOff. "I don't want to elaborate at this point. It was a tough call."
Vasili Manousakis, who served as assistant coach under McCarthy, is now in charge of City on an interim basis.
Asked whether he is targeting a coach from overseas or evaluating local options, Comitis added: "No decisions have been made. We have to consider all our options."
Meanwhile former Ajax Cape Town head coach Muhsin Ertugral is being tipped to replace McCarthy as head coach after being spotted in Cape Town.
Cape Town City find themselves in 13th position in the Absa Premiership standings, but a win over Polokwane City on Wednesday could see them climb up to ninth.
Kick-off is at 19:30.
