        Bakkt saw an overnight spike in Bitcoin futures trading volumes, despite the relatively sluggish price action. BTCâ€™s trek to above the $9,400 mark inspired futures markets to gain activity.
      
The Bakkt Bitcoin futures platform traded 1,061 contracts today, which is a 96% appreciation from the previous day.
