Online shops are definitely a part of our lives. In the US, for example, in 2018, people spent 5 hours a week shopping online. But not all of their purchases have a happy ending. Inexperienced users often don’t check the rating of the seller and only pay attention to the low price of the product. In cases like this, funny things happen: like buying an unexpected holiday costume for your dog, ordering a cool dress that looks like a piece of old cloth, and realizing that the caption on the baseball cap you ordered is not exactly what you expected it to be.
Bright Side has found some bittersweet examples of online shopping experiences.
