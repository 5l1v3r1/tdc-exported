If you thought fiery pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho — currently facing a potential lawsuit and newly doctorate-less after his alma mater stripped his honorary degree — might take a break from the spotlight and make some time for quiet introspection, well, buddy, you don’t know Junius Ho.
According to NOW TV News, Ho has announced he is suing lawmakers Dennis Kwok, Claudia Mo, and Lam Cheuk-ting — the man behind the legal action against Ho — for chanting “Junius Ho, triad” at a police demonstration of their new water cannon trucks on Aug. 12.
The TV station reported that in a High Court filing, Ho said the remarks were unfounded and not true, and demanded damages and an injunction to prevent the trio from making similar statements.
The remarks in question were made at an event at the police tactical unit in Fanling attended by members of the Legislative Council. Kwok, Lam, and Mo staged a protest during the demonstration by holding placards accusing the police of “attempted murder.” Ho at one point called the protesting lawmakers “bloody idiots,” as he is wont to do.
In a video filmed by Ming Pao, some lawmakers can be heard saying “Junius Ho, triad.” Pro-democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin can also be heard yelling to police “sir, this guy is a triad.”
