FORT MYERS, Fla. -- A Fort Myers city councilman is saying he has some concerns about the police department's newly-appointed inspector general.
Councilman Johnny Streets says he is going to bring up a motion on Monday to discuss the new hire.
Last month, the city hired Donald Oswald for the position . Part of his job will be reviewing Internal Affairs investigations and looking at how officers are disciplined.
Streets says he supports the hire, but says the position should not report to Police Chief Derrick Diggs. That's how Oswald's job is set up right now.
Instead, Streets says the position should be independent of police control.
