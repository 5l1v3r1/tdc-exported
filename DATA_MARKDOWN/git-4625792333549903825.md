Presidential contender Pete Buttigieg’s former chief of staff was elected to replace him as the next mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Democrat James Mueller, 37, won the race against Republican Sean Haas with 66% of the vote, according to the South Bend Tribune.
Mueller was a high school classmate and friend of Buttigieg, 37, who moved back to South Bend in 2015 to serve as his chief of staff. Buttigieg endorsed Mueller’s candidacy in February after announcing last November that he would not be seeking a third term for mayor.
“The progress over the last eight years in our city is undeniable,” he told supporters Tuesday night. “Yet we still have a lot more work to do to take our growth to the next level and make sure everyone can share in our progress.”
Mueller’s candidacy was seen by some as a referendum on Buttigieg’s policies and his time as mayor. Mueller’s slogan for his campaign was, “Keep South Bend Moving Forward.”
Buttigieg congratulated Mueller on the victory Tuesday, writing on Twitter, “Big congratulations to James @MuellerforMayor and all of the South Bend Common Council members elected tonight! Great opportunities are ahead for continued progress and inclusive growth in our hometown.”
