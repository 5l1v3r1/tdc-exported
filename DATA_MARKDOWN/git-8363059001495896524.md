Some questions don’t ever get settled. That’s what’s exciting, and frustrating, about art and philosophy: you ponder the same sorts of things over and over again.

I don’t remember that debate ever reaching the public mind quite as much as it has lately with Joker. Arthur’s actions in the film bear a resemblance to real, awful acts of violence, and it’s understandably made some people uncomfortable, and people have argued that Joker represents those actions in an irresponsible, even glorifying way.
