        New Delhi (Sputnik): With the recent controversy over an alleged Israeli spyware-attack via WhatsApp on several Indian political leaders, social activists and journalists still in the news, speculation about a malware attack on an Indian nuclear plant has come to the forefront, raising questions about cybersecurity in India.
      
A South Korean cybersecurity firm claims that the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in southern India’s Tamil Nadu state was attacked by North Korean “DTrack” malware in an attempt to obtain internal information about “thorium-based nuclear power”.
Located off the Bay of Bengal in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu state, the power plant is the single largest nuclear power station in India.
