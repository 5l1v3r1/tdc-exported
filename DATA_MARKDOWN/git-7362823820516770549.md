An NBA fan accused of punching a New Orleans Pelicans coach in the face late last month reportedly has been banned from all NBA, WNBA and G-League games, as well as 2K League events.
Manuel Garcia, 38, was arrested last week after he allegedly punched Pelicans assistant coach Joe Boylan in the face after the Pelicans wrapped up a win against the Houston Rockets. Garcia, a Rockets fan, appeared to strike Boylan from the sideline.

The Athletic reported Sunday that Garcia has been banned from all NBA-related events.
Garcia was charged with misdemeanor assault and was out on bail working to secure a lawyer, according to ABC13 Houston. Even before the leaguewide ban, he was forbidden from attending Rockets games.
