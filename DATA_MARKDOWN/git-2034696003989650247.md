Panic! At The Disco have released their rendition of ‘Into The Unknown’, a song from the forthcoming sequel to the hit Disney movie Frozen.
Panic’s version of the song – sung in the movie by Elsa – features guitar riffs and rousing backing vocals, not to mention powerful singing by frontman Brendon Urie.
“Everyone I’ve ever loved is here within these walls / I’m sorry secret siren, but I’m blocking out your calls / I’ve had my adventure / I don’t need something new / I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you / Into the unknown,” Urie belts.
Watch the lyric video for Panic’s rendition of ‘Into The Unknown’ below.
