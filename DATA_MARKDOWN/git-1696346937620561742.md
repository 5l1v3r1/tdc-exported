It was reported this week that software giant Microsoft has created a platform for self-issuance of Ethereum based tokens. Forbes, which has been known for its fair share of FUD and misreporting when it comes to crypto, reported that Azure Blockchain Tokens went live for preview and testing.
The platform is aimed at enterprises and a few have already started minting their own tokens. At the moment users will have access to a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain that uses the firm’s Azure cloud computing to reach a consensus on transactions.
