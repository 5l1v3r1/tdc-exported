ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - Authorities are investigating the suicide of a jail inmate in Aspen awaiting mental health treatment.
The Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office says 64-year-old Jillian White was found unconscious and unresponsive in her cell Sunday and deputies weren’t able to revive her. Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told The Aspen Times that she was last checked on between 15 and 30 minutes before.
White had a history of theft and drunken driving allegations. She was arrested in August for allegedly stealing from neighbors and was recently found incompetent to stand trial.
Prosecutors say that her lawyer told the court Friday that she had found a private mental health facility for White to be sent to instead of the state hospital and requested that she be transferred there.
