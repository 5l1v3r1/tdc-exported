HARRIS COUNTY, Texas – A Texas appeals court ruled that a county is immune in a negligence lawsuit brought by the family of a woman who was killed when she was struck by a driver who was fleeing from police in a stolen vehicle. 
Texas law grants such immunity in cases in which the incident arises from police responding to an emergency.
