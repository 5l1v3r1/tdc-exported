People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith has said she and US singer Cher are “best pals” after she tweeted her opposition to oil and gas fracking.
Ms Smith has been a vocal critic of the Government’s support for the controversial Shannon LNG project that would facilitate importation of fracked gas from US to Ireland.
Fracking is a technique in which high-pressure water, sand and chemicals are pumped into shale rock to help extract natural gas.
Cher tweeted a link today asking the Government not to let the plan go ahead as Ireland has already banned fracking.
