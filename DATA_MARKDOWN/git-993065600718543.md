Sir Trevor McDonald said he turned down a BBC job before he became a big name after he was told the broadcaster needed “more black reporters”.
The former ITV newscaster, 80, said he was approached by the corporation “very, very early in my career”.
He told The Jonathan Ross show:  “I got a call from somebody at the BBC saying, ‘Could you come over? I’d like to interview you.’
“There was a lot of white wine and smoked salmon sandwiches and I thought all my ships were coming in at once.
