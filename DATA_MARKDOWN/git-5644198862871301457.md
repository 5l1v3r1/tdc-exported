Wall Street was on course to open close to record highs on Wednesday as investors digested a corporate earnings season that has seen the bulk of U.S.-listed firms best analysts' expectations, funding another round of stock market gains.
REUTERS: The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes opened near record highs on Wednesday, as a largely upbeat corporate earnings season and optimism around a U.S.-China trade truce drive a Wall Street rally.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.11 points, or 0.04per cent, at the open to 27,502.74.
The S&P 500 opened higher by 0.48 points, or 0.02per cent, at 3,075.10. The Nasdaq Composite , however, dropped 8.11 points, or 0.10per cent, to 8,426.57 at the opening bell.
