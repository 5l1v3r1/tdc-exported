        Washington has previously sanctioned Vice President Rosario Murillo and National Police Chief Francisco Diaz implicated in the brutal repression of anti-government protesters that began more than a year ago, according to the previous press release.
      
The US has imposed sanctions on three Nicaraguans under a programme targeting the president Daniel Ortega government, the US Treasury said on its website. The US Treasury Department said it had placed Deputy Director-General of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) Ramon Antonio Avellan Medal, acting President of the Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) Lumberto Ignacio Campbell Hooker and Director of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) Roberto Jose Lopez Gomez on a sanctions list.
