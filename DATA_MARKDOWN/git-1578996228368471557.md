Kendall Jenner had her first birthday celebration last night, putting on a major Halloween costume party for her friends. The model will turn 24 on November 3 and teased that she was "keeping the halloween birthday party alive for mom," before the party on her Instagram.
Kendall shared several Instagrams of her A-list guests partying with her and revealed their costumes. Kacey Musgraves, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin, Emily Ratajkowski, and Kylie Jenner were among the company. Emily Ratajkowski also attended, along with Caitlyn Jenner, who dressed up as a vampire.
