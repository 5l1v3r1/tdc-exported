Audi Sport has snatched the title of 'fastest production SUV, off-road vehicle, van or pick-up' around the Nurburgring Nordschleife from Mercedes-Benz, posting a time of 7 minutes 42.253 seconds in the upcoming 2020 RS Q8 super SUV.
With champion race car driver Frank Stippler at the wheel, the RS Q8 was over 12 seconds quicker than the previous record holder – the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 S – which set a benchmark of 7 minutes 54.40 seconds on November 6 last year.
At this this stage we don't exactly know all the details about Audi's new flagship go-fast crossover, though we do know it will be powered by the same 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 as the latest RS6 Avant and RS7 Sportback.
In those models, the blown bent eight makes a healthy 441kW of power and 800Nm of torque. By comparison, the related Lamborghini Urus makes an even beefier 478kW and 850Nm from the same displacement.
Official performance times and specifications will be confirmed when the RS Q8 is revealed later this year, though if you watch the video below you'll see Stippler almost hit an indicated 190mph (305km/h) – so trust the RS Q8 will be a serious bit of kit.
From 2019, lap records at the Nurburgring are officially recorded, confirmed and published by the racetrack's team.
While the RS Q8 is the fastest SUV around the Nordschleife, its about a minute off the time posted by the Porsche 911 GT2 RS MR last year, and about 20 seconds behind the Jaguar XE SV Project 8.
