Former Celtic keeper Rab Douglas has urged Craig Gordon to leave the club in January in a bid to find first team football.
The veteran goalie has dropped down the pecking order at the Parkhead club with the arrival of Fraser Forster on loan at Southampton.
Scott Bain has also been handed a new four-year deal and looks to be a part of Celtic 's long-term plans after displacing Gordon at the number one spot last season.
And Arbroath goalkeeping coach Douglas believes Gordon, 36, needs to be playing regularly at this stage in his career.
He told BBC Sportsound : "I think it will get to January and Craig (Gordon) will have a discussion with Lennon.
"I don't think anybody wants to sit in the bench, it's not about the money. Craig will have enough money.
"The big thing is going out playing and enjoying it. He's coming to the tail end of his career now, he needs to go to a level where he is really enjoying his football.
"I think the wages as well, Celtic might want to free up ages and bring a younger goalie in. They've certainly got the two boys out at Championship clubs on loan so it will be interesting how Lennon deals with that."
