Given the massive collection of titles on Steam, now that even EA has decided to make a comeback, Valve's gaming distribution platform certainly isn't short on developer support and would only need them to be legally on-board if it decides to compete in the cloud gaming space.
This indeed is what Steam Database (SteamDB) discovered in a Github release on Valve's partner site code, stating that they (partners) "must agree to the terms in the Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum before continuing," leading many to believe that Valve could be working on a new cloud gaming service for Steam.
