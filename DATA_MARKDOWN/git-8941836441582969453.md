DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) - Author, professor and activist Marc Lamont Hill plans to speak at a Detroit-area gathering of Arab Americans aimed at confronting issues facing the community.
Hill is set to speak Friday during a three-day conference called MOVE. It stands for Mobilize, Organize, Vocalize and Empower, and is being held at Dearborn’s Henry hotel.
Organizers say Hill will discuss collective power and energizing communities into action.
The Temple University professor is host of BET News. He was a CNN contributor, but they parted ways last year after he spoke about Israel and Palestine at the United Nations.
Hill called for a boycott of Israel and a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.” The Anti-Defamation League and other groups said the “river to the sea” phrase is code for eliminating Israel, but the professor said it was “not a call to destroy anything or anyone.”
