My career really took off as part of the 2004 election cycle, so my answer is more of a 15-year perspective, but here goes.
2004 was the first time we saw online fundraising really be a thing in the US. This is now a major component of how most politicians fuel their campaigns. At that time there was no Youtube, Facebook was a niche service for ivy league kids, and neither Twitter or smartphones existed. It was a different world for sure.
The big changes in the digital political landscape from a communications standpoint have been the mainstreaming of social platforms and the way in which the ubiquity of mobile devices has erased the distinction between offline and online. It’s now considered standard that campaigns operate in real-time, and we’re only going to see more campaigns that are effectively live-streamed.
Data is also a major part of every campaign now, as is online grassroots organizing. Online fundraising and outreach is relentlessly optimized and A/B tested. In some ways campaigns are ahead of most marketing organizations in this sense, again as the result of such fierce competition.
