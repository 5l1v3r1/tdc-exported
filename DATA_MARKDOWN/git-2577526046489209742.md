Wondering what a Overwatch sequel means to players of the existing game? Blizzard asked themselves the same question, and the answer is to make sure so much content is shared with existing players, that you might not need to buy Overwatch 2 at all.
A key concern for the Overwatch community is what would happen to the hundreds of hours they've spent levelling up, unlocking skins, emotes and various cosmetics. The good news is all of that will carry over into Overwatch 2.
But if you don't buy Overwatch 2, you won't be left out. Telling the Blizzcon crowd that they wanted to change the idea of what a sequel was, Jeff Kaplan announced that Overwatch 1 players would be able to play in the same games as Overwatch 2 players, on the same maps with the same heroes.
