NEW DELHI: Mushfiqur Rahim singlehandedly fired Bangladesh to their maiden T20I win over India with an unbeaten 60, choking the fancied hosts in the smog-hit series opener here on Sunday.
As cricket took centre stage despite severe pollution, Bangladesh negotiated the pitch much better than India, who made 148 for six on a sticky surface.

The Indian batsmen appeared over-cautious after being invited to bat as the young brigade disappointed the 25,000 strong fans, who braved severe smog to pack the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
