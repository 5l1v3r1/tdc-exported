Dropbox Transfer has left beta and is now available for all customers. The handy feature allows for sharing of very large files up to 100GB in size.
Dropbox Transfer rolled out to a limited group of users last summer. Now Dropbox has announced that the feature is available for users on all plans of its service (with varying limits).
Dropbox touts that Transfer allows customers to “send up 100 GB of files in just a few clicks.” You can also select files from your computer’s hard drive to share in addition to what’s saved on Dropbox. When sharing, you can password protect files and more.
Notably, Apple’s Mail Drop feature to share large files through email with the help of iCloud has a limit of 5GB.
Here’s the limit breakdown by plan type:
Along with the full release of Transfer, Dropbox is also rolling out support through the iOS and desktop apps in addition to Dropbox.com. Further, users can customize backgrounds that others see when viewing shared content.
