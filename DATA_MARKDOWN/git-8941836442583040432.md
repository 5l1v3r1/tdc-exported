The Washington Nationals are giving the Capitals a run for their money when it comes to celebrating a championship. 
The Nationals showed up to Capital One Arena on Sunday to celebrate their World Series title. They were honored on ice before the game, rode shirtless on a Zamboni during intermission and partied with the Capitals in the locker room afterward. 
Oh, and there was beer, so much beer. 
Periodically throughout the Capitals‘ 4-2 win over the Flames, the Nationals would hoist the World Series trophy from their suite. They drew big cheers from the crowd throughout.
The Nationals and Capitals have a close bond. When the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018, they spent a day at Nationals Park. Star Alex Ovechkin also threw out the first pitch for the Nationals in the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Here are some highlights from the evening — which include outfielder Adam Eaton shot-gunning a beer through his shirt, made famous by T.J. Oshie:
