Black Friday, Nov. 29, 2019, is on its way. And with it, big box retailers like Target are readying their doors with a full spread of 4K TVs, Nintendo Switches, Xbox One X consoles and an array of video games.
Target released its Black Friday ad today, with an Xbox One S 1TB bundle with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (launching Nov. 15) that’s listed for $199.99. There is also an Xbox One X bundled with Gears 5 for $349.99. A slew of 4K TV deals, in all sizes and with varying features, help anchor Target’s deals.
We’ll be rounding up the best Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals until Black Friday is here, while updating these posts as products sell out and new deals are announced.
