A gunman reportedly killed four people and injured several others at a college Halloween party in California.
The bloodbath took place at an Airbnb in Orinda County where students were celebrating the holiday.
At 10.45pm police were called after shots were fired.
Contra Costa County Sheriff's office tweeted: "Orinda Police Department and Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff are working a multiple shooting in Orinda.
"Investigation is active. Details coming later."
It is believed the students were from Laney College, a public community college in Oakland.
No information has been released by the authorities regarding the victims' identities.
Videos of the scene shows multiple patients being loaded into an ambulance while others limp away from the property.
Around 100 people are thought to have been at the party, which was advertised on Instagram as an 'AirBNB mansion party', East Bay Times reported.
Attendees were told to send a private message to the organisers to find out the location, and to bring their own alcohol and cannabis.
The violent events follow a mass shooting that left three dead and nine others wounded in at another Halloween party in Long Beach, California on Tuesday.
