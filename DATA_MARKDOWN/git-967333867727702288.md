The wild beast was caught off guard as he lazed atop a battle tank, once captured from the Pakistani Army during a 1965 battle.
The leopard was snapped looking into the camera with his piercing eyes after it woke up from the flash of the camera.
Pictures of the wild cat relaxing on top of the captured tank, like a boss, has taken a social media by storm, as netizens were left gawking at the fierce animal.
