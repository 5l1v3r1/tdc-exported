It was said that Jimmy Garoppolo was attempting to hit on FOX reporter Erin Andrews during a postgame interview last Thursday night, but the 49ers quarterback strongly denies doing so.
Jimmy G was asked about how he felt regarding the team’s win over the Seahawks on “Thursday Night Football,” and he was pumped about it in his postgame interview.
“Feels great, baby,” Garoppolo told Andrews.
