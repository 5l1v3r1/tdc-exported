        New Delhi (Sputnik): “Referendum 2020” is an online secessionist campaign, which aims to create a separate independent state of Khalistan for the Sikh community, launched by a US-based group called “Sikhs for Justice".
      
Google play - the official app store for Android apps on Google is facing the wrath of social media users after the app “2020 Sikh Referendum” was made available for download by users.
Social media users were miffed after coming across the app, listed on the Play Store as already having more than 1,000 downloads, and slammed the tech giant for allowing the radical extremist movement to be on its platform.
Several people have called it anti-India propaganda, while urging others to report it as “inappropriate” to have it taken down.
