Several air and boat crews have been actively searching the waters some 4 miles south of Hurlburt Field, Florida, since a US Air Force service member from the 24th Special Operations Wing went missing at around 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
In addition to groups from Hurlburt Field, the Coast Guard has deployed three separate aircrews and a number of boat crews, according to the Air Force Times.
The US Army’s 7th Special Forces Group, Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are also scouring the area to locate the missing airman.
Rescue efforts are taking place within a 700-square-mile area. The airman’s identity has not yet been released.
