US whistleblower Edward Snowden has appealed to common sense when explaining his irreconcilable stance on interviews with Russian news outlets.
When asked by Elena Chernenko from the Russian daily Kommersant if it’s true that he doesn’t want to talk to the Russian press, the Former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor tweeted that “someone facing serious threats may not want their face all over newspapers and TV every day in the place they live”.
