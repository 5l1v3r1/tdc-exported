The UK construction sector continued its decline in October, survey data has shown, with overall volumes of work falling for the sixth straight month.
The construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a gauge of the health of the sector – registered 44.2 in October, up from 43.3 in September, data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed.
A score of below 50 indicates contraction, meaning the construction sector is in sustained decline, and still not far off the 10-year low seen in June.
Civil engineering was the worst-performing area, with business activity falling at the sharpest pace in 10 years.
