Galatasaray will not be able to call on star forward Radamel Falcao to play Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, because the player has not recovered from a tendon injury.
Falcao got injured at PSG on October 4 and is taking treatment in Spain at the moment. Falcao might, as a former Atletico Madrid player, have liked to take on Los Blancos.
The Colombian legend will stay in Spain getting treatment until Nov. 11, as revealed by Galatasaray medic Yener Ince on their social media accounts.
