Fossil Group today announced Hybrid HR, the latest addition to the hybrid smartwatch category. The new Hybrid HR smartwatch features always-on e-ink display that can display important information such as text messages, alerts, caller ID, heart rate and activity tracking. Fossil claims that this new smartwatch will offer 2 weeks of battery life. It is important to note that Hybrid HR is not powered by Google’s WearOS, instead it runs on proprietary platform developed in-house by Fossil.
“With Hybrid HR, we continue to broaden Fossil Group’s diverse portfolio, offering the most – and most innovative – hybrid and touchscreen smartwatch options of any company in the world,” said McKelvey.
