The BBC reportedly made an unforced error in revealing the names of 120 female employees who had made complaints about equal pay.
The Guardian said Thursday that it had obtained a list that "includes many household names," workers who took issue with an apparent disparity in gender pay within the company. Many of them had previously signed a letter to the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) in 2017.
The unredacted list emerged as part of BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed's legal battle against the company.
The BBC did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment. However, in a statement to The Guardian, a spokesperson insisted the network was not responsible for the leaked list.

"This list was part of the evidence that the NUJ put before the tribunal, not the BBC,” the BBC spokesperson told The Guardian.
In an internal email sent to employees on Thursday, the BBC notified those who had filed complaints that they would were going to be named publicly.
