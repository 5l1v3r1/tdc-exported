        The band suffered a serious crash whilst on tour recently.
      
SWMRS have given an update about the recovery of their band members following a van crash two weeks ago which injured several members of the band.
After performing at Uncool Fest two weeks ago, the group were involved in a road accident when their vehicle hit a patch of black ice. Joey Armstrong, son of Green Day frontman Billie Joe, plays drums in the Californian punk-rock outfit alongside Cole Becker, Max Becker, and Seb Mueller.
Following the incident, guitarist and vocalist Max Becker was placed in intensive care alongside touring crew members Natalie Somekh and Josh Berl.
Now, the band have revealed that Natalie and Josh are both back at home whilst Max, meanwhile, enters a programme of rehabilitation to help him recover from his injuries.
On Twitter, the band wrote: “hey y’all- Natalie & Josh both made it home! Max is spending his last night in Wyoming tonight before being transferred to a live in Rehab Clinic. Once we have the address for that we want to flood it with letters of support and other gifts to make him feel as loved as he is.”
