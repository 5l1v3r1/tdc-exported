A comprehensive survey by the New York Times and Siena College reveals how Biden’s most conservative supporters want less legal immigration to the U.S. — a potential inroad for President Trump and his “America First” agenda.
The survey finds that 41 percent of Biden voters who do not support Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) say women running for president “just aren’t that likable.” These Biden voters, the survey finds, are mostly men and working class who align with Trump on a series of cultural and political issues.
For example, of these Biden voters, a majority of 54 percent said they want to reduce legal immigration levels wherein currently the U.S. admits about 1.2 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year who compete for jobs against working and middle class Americans.
