        "In space, no one can hear you scream." "The horror, the horror." "Be afraid. Be very afraid."
      
It's easy to be lured into watching a horror film or indeed a non-serious film because of the tagline on the poster – the above few are an example of that.
That's why it should be respected when a one-sheet manages to catch your attention with a tagline that manages to make you laugh.
This is standard practice for a comedy – a film that's purporting to be funny should really have a hilarious tagline. But there have also been some films – action thrillers, for example – where the studio opts to go down the funny route anyway (see: Bride of Chucky, Predator 2, True Lies).
We've compiled the funniest taglines in film history – click through the below gallery to see what made the list.
