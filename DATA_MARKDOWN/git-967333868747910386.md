        The video, reportedly made in-house by the presidential candidate’s campaign staff, is strikingly similar to that uploaded by the campaign to YouTube a month ago. The ad will air in New Hampshire for two weeks.
      
Bernie Sanders’s campaign unveiled its first TV ad on Wednesday. Titled ‘Fight for US’, it uses the same voiceover as an earlier ‘Fight for US’ video posted to Sanders’s YouTube channel in October, but with updated video footage. 
According to The Hill, the 60-second video will be aired in New Hampshire for two weeks, reportedly costing the campaign $1 million. The ad will also be distributed online, the report says. New Hampshire is the first state to hold a primary in the upcoming 2020 elections.
