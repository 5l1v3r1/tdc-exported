After facing some downwards pressure yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) has been able to incur some upwards momentum that has allowed it to climb back to $9,300, which marks a slight climb from its daily lows of $9,150.
Analysts are now noting that Bitcoin is currently caught within a wide descending channel over a long-time frame, but a bullish formation that it is currently caught within on a lower-time frame may mean that a visit to the upper boundary of this channel is imminent.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trading up roughly 1% at its current price of $9,300, which is the highest point that it has been trading at over the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin’s short-term bullishness came about after the crypto briefly visited $9,150 yesterday, which appears to be a near-term level of support that could bolster the cryptocurrency’s price action in the near-term.
It is important to note that the past few weeks have marked a consolidation period for the cryptocurrency, which has been ranging between $9,000 and $9,500 ever since it incurred its meteoric rally to $9,500.
Big Chonis, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that a technical formation may signal that a big price movement is imminent.
