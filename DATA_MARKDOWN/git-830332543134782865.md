MADISON, Wis. - Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is demanding Republican legislators vote on a pair of bills restricting firearm ownership.
Evers in October ordered a special legislative session on gun control to begin Tuesday afternoon. He wants to them to vote on bills mandating universal background checks and allowing family members or police to ask judges to temporarily seize firearms from people who pose a threat.
