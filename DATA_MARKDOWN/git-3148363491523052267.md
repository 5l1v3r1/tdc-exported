Writing for National Review, Victor Davis Hanson made the case that American colleges are producing “woke and broke” graduates.
Hanson points out that Americans that have graduated from college since the year 2000 have both lower rates of patriotism and home ownership. Recent college graduates are often ill-informed on American history. Hanson believes that colleges and universities are to blame for this recent wave of low-skilled and anti-American graduates.
Hanson argues that American colleges don’t even give their students an opportunity to engage with conservative ideas. According to Hanson, administrators and leftist activists ensure that dissenters on hot-button issues are quickly shamed or removed from campus.
Hanson argued that many students have irresponsibly taken on massive student loan debt in order to enroll in degree programs that will not lead them on the path towards a lucrative career. As a result, according to Hanson, students end up joining groups like Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and Occupy Wall Street, as an outlet for their financial frustrations.
