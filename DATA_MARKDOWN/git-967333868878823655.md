        The walls surrounding the former US Embassy in Iran have featured a series of anti-American murals for many years, becoming a major tourist attraction, as well as a reminder of the continued tensions between the two countries since the 1979 Revolution, when Iranians overthrew the US-backed Shah installed by the CIA in 1953.
      
Sixteen new murals have been unveiled at the former US Embassy in Tehran ahead of the 40th anniversary of the compound’s November 4, 1979 takeover.
The images, painted in the colours of the American flag, feature a series of well-known American cultural products, corporations, weapons systems, and various historical events.
Among the murals is a painting dedicated to the June 2019 incident in which Iran destroyed a $220 million US spy drone. Another image shows an Iranian player’s goal against the US at the 1998 World Cup. Yet another is dedicated to the July 3, 1988 shootdown of an Iranian passenger jet by US forces in the Persian Gulf, which claimed 290 lives.
