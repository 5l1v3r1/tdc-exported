Felicity Jones feared she had broken her back in a hot air balloon crash while filming her latest movie.
The Rogue One actress, 36, and co-star Eddie Redmayne, 37, had an accident while filming The Aeronauts.
Jones, who plays an obsessive air balloon pilot in the movie, told Porter: “My eye missed the metal corner of this wooden chest, by about five centimetres.
“I was wearing a corset as well, to add insult to injury.
