Ryan Reynolds is a big fan of his brand of gin, Aviation Gin, and he’s also a fan of trolling online. When he gets the opportunity to combine the two, he takes it, which is what happened this week when the actor opted to troll Justice League’s Mustachegate in a fun post.
This means we both get to see Ryan Reynolds with a mustache, possibly courtesy of Movember, as well as what it takes to CGI the heck out of it to produce a nice, not-so-cleanshaven alcohol ad. Take a look below.
