Real Betis have picked up four points in their last two games to ease the pressure on Rubi going into Sunday's derby against Sevilla.
Betis, who beat Celta Vigo and then drew with Real Madrid, go into the derby with the coaching staff, the board and the players all rowing in the same direction.
Ángel Haro and José Miguel López Catalán, the club's president and vice president, were present at Thursday's training session which was behind closed doors.
Their presence was to offer their support to Rubi, who has been questioned following his summer move from Espanyol amid poor results.
However, the win against Celta -- when the players made it clear they backed their boss -- and the draw with Madrid have eased the pressure on Rubi.
