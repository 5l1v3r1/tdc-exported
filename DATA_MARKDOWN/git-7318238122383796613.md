After a week stranded at seas with 88 migrants onboard, German rescue ship Alan Kurdi docked in the Italian port of Taranto on Sunday, following a deal among EU nations.
Italy granted permission for migrants to disembark on Friday after Germany and other EU countries agreed to take in the migrants.
"Germany and France will take in 60 migrants, Portugal 5 and Ireland 2," the Interior Ministry said.
"We are extremely relieved to finally bring the remaining 88 exhausted and traumatised rescued persons to a safe port soon," said German NGO Sea-Eye, which operates the ship.
