        MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Russian Armed Forces have spotted 20 foreign aircraft that were engaged in reconnaissance activities close to Russia's airspace during the past week, the military's official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda reported on Friday.
      
A weekly infographic published by the outlet showed that Russian jets had been scrambled 12 times to intercept foreign aircraft. No foreign planes have illegally entered Russia's airspace.
Earlier in the month, a B-52 bomber of the United States Air Force approached Russia's borders near the exclave of Kaliningrad aiming at carrying out a simulated bombing of a local Russian Baltic Fleet’s base.
