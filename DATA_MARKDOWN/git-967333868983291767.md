        Dogs can perceive images on a screen in the same way we do. And they are smart enough to recognise images of animals, even those that they have never seen, and of course, they easily recognise dogs barking.
      
Some dog owners leave a radio or TV switched on when they leave the home so that their pets don't feel sad or bored.
In this video, three tired golden retrievers relax in bed, watching videos on a smartphone.
