Two teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man died of stab wounds in Rugby, Warwickshire police have said.
Officers were called shortly after 6pm on Thursday to Meadow Road, where a man in his 20s was found dead.
The 16- and 17-year-old boys remain in custody and police have asked for any possible witnesses to come forward.
Ch Insp Karl Faulkner appealed to anyone who may have witnessed that incident, or a possible altercation on Thursday evening involving a car passenger and a cyclist in the bridge area of Parkfield Road.
Witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of either of the incidents is asked to contact Warwickshire police or Crimestoppers.
