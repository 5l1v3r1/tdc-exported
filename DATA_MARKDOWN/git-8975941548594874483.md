President Donald Trump’s permanent address is no longer New York City.
In a series of tweets Thursday night, the president said he has moved his permanent residence to Palm Beach, Fla., and said he had been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” of New York. “Few have been treated worse,” he said, through he added New York “will always have a special place in my heart!”
