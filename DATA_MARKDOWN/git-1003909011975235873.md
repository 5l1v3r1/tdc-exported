Invited guests enjoyed Ann McCaig’s renowned hospitality and warmth on Sept. 23 at an event to support the Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. McCaig is a member of the Friends board and invited people to her home to learn more about Canada’s new national museum — the only one located in Western Canada.
Museum president and CEO Dr. John Young talked about the museum’s work to cultivate dialogue and respect across Canada and around the world. Philanthropist Gail Asper, whose family spearheaded the campaign to found and build the museum, shared some of her insights as well.
