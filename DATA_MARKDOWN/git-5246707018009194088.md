Here's the story you've all been waiting for, folks: Nintendo's official customer support has today shared a message regarding the dangers of pets urinating on your favourite consoles.
We can't quite believe it either, but in a world where products have to come with all sorts of ridiculous warnings just in case someone was silly enough to eat a lightbulb or something, it does kind of make sense. The warning comes from @nintendo_cs, Nintendo's official Japanese customer support service, and talks about keeping an eye on your pet in general.
