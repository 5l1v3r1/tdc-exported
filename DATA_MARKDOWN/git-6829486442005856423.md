If there’s one show we should all be excited about, it’s HBO’s adaptation of His Dark Materials.
It’s being touted as the next HBO show to replace Game of Thrones, but to be honest, that comparison is already extremely tired. The highly anticipated show is an adaptation of the extremely beloved Philip Pullman books, and is a joint venture between the BBC and HBO.
The series sits slightly within the shadow of the 2007 film adaptation, The Golden Compass, which was a critical and commercial flop. All of this means that people have been excited.. but nervous.
