In a recent interview with Fox Sports, Netherlands boss Ronaldo Koeman confirmed that he has a "Barcelona clause" in his contract that would allow him to leave his role with the national team to step into Barca's dugout.
Koeman, who spent six seasons with the Blaugrana as a player, confirmed the reports after the Dutch federation's director Nico-Jan Hoogma brought the revelation to light last week, and stressed that the LaLiga giants were the "only club" he would leave the Netherlands job for.

According to the reports, the clause can only be activated after the 2020 UEFA European Championship, and Koeman has stressed that he is "100% committed" to overseeing his side's tournament campaign.
Pressure has been mounting on current Barcelona boss Valverde, and it has been reported that that club could turn to Koeman at the end of the season, once the European Championship has reached its conclusion.
