Are you an AT&T customer on an unlimited data plan? Have you had the feeling that sometimes your phone carrier was deliberately slowing you down? The FCC says you aren't wrong, and that AT&T must pay $60 million in settlement for slowing cellphone data on unlimited plans.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said on Tuesday it will require AT&T to pay a $60 million settlement to resolve the government's charges that the phone carrier cheated millions of American customers by charging them for “unlimited” data plans but reducing their data speeds if they used more than a certain undisclosed amount.
“Scammers come in all sizes,” FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement.
