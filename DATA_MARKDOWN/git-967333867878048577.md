Tara Brooks, a 34-year old ex-prison guard who lost her job Parklea Correctional Centre in Sydney earlier this year over an “inappropriate relationship” with one of the male inmates, made an appearance at the Maxim Hot 100 list party in what news.com.au described as “an unusual return to the spotlight.”
As the media outlet points out, Tara, who was a part-time model prior to her brief career as a corrections officer, was found guilty of engaging in an “intimate” relationship with Hassan Zreika, a 41-year old convicted drug dealer.
In October, Brooks managed to successfully appeal the conviction, though the conditional release order remains in place.
