His Dark Materials premiered last night, and frankly, everyone is gagging about the beautifully lush fantasy world, the strange and grim and wondrous tone, and the stellar performances.
It’s a gorgeous show, truly a product of the golden age of prestige television that we’re currently in, especially the huge fantasy adaptations.
But — that’s not everything that people are gagging about.
Lyra’s mysterious and brilliant uncle is the Lord Asriel, played perfectly by James McAvoy — he has just the right mixture of aggressive genius, and slightly tortured visionary to properly sell the role.
Also, he’s fucking hot. Honestly, this handsome science daddy can photograph me like one of his dust models. He can overthrow my magisterium. He can swaddle me up like a baby and abandon me at a university.
God damn. And I’m not alone in being horny for the magic father/uncle.
