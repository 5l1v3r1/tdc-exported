ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Vernon Davis will miss his fifth straight game with a concussion when the Washington Redskins visit the Buffalo Bills in Week 9.
Davis was among several starters and regular contributors were already ruled out Friday, including safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett, both with ankle injuries, and running back Chris Thompson with turf toe. 
Case Keenum is out with the concussion he sustained last week against Minnesota, paving the way for Dwayne Haskins’ first NFL start. Colt McCoy will be Haskins’ backup.
Guard Wes Martin and cornerback Aaron Colvin are Washington’s other inactives.
Trent Williams is not on the list of inactives, but he has a roster exemption and doesn’t count toward the 53-man roster yet. The team declared he failed his physical after returning from his lengthy holdout this week, when he experienced discomfort trying on his helmet.
