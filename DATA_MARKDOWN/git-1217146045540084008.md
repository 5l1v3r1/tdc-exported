The most notable changes found in this new build released to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring are detailed below.
Microsoft has added four new quick web searches to the Start Menu search home that allow you to quickly get your local weather, check for new movies, read the top news, and see historic events that happened this day.
This feature is coming to Windows 10 1809 through to 20H1 in the USA. As this is a server side change, users will start to see this new functionality as it rolls out to different regions.
This build also includes an updated design for the web preview in search results.
