        Recently, the Nationals Park stadium in DC, mostly filled with Washington Nationals fans, overwhelmingly booed Donald Trump as he attended Game 5 of the World Series just hours after announcing the death of Daesh* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi at the hands of the US military.
      
Washington Nationals pitcher and most valuable player of the World Series 2019 Stephen Strasburg has returned to his long-dormant Twitter account in order to comment on a viral video where it looks like he refused to shake hands with US President Donald Trump during the Nationals' recent visit to the White House. The athlete reposted the video, simply adding the hashtag #FakeNews.
