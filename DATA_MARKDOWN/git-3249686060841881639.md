The ubiquitous K-pop band BTS recently concluded their last tour for their Speak Yourself tour in Seoul. It was a phenomenal successas usual, and all the performances were very much appreciated.
One of the solo performances, though, stole the entire show.
"Singularity" performed by Kim Taehyung aka BTS V was even more dazzling than usual. BTS V's outfit of black feathers coupled with his gorgeous visuals was so ethereal that k-netz gave him the nickname of "Black Swan". 
His performance was so eye-catching that KBS new channel said that it was the highlight of Seoul concert.
