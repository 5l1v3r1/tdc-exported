San Francisco’s game-manager turned into quite the game-changer in an impressive performance.
Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 317 yards and four touchdowns on a night his team’s vaunted defense wasn’t at its best, and the San Francisco 49ers reached the halfway point of their season undefeated, beating the Arizona Cardinals 28-25 on Thursday.
For a quarterback who often gets the backhanded compliment of being a good game-manager, Garoppolo’s stellar performance provided some proof that the 27-year-old might be a little better than people think.
His teammates already knew.
“Yeah, he’s pretty good,” San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle said. “I don’t know why people don’t think he is. He makes some pretty gutsy throws out there, doesn’t he? Goodness gracious.”
