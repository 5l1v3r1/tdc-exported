KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine is moving quickly toward agreeing a new three-year loan program with the International Monetary Fund, Finance Minister Oksana Markarova told reporters on Tuesday, denying suggestions that talks for a new deal had stalled.
Speaking at the same briefing, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said the government expected to receive 12 billion hryvnias ($485 million) next year from selling state-owned firms, and that it would do everything to bring down inflation.
