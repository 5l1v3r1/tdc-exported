(Updated: 1:52 p.m. EST, 11/6/2019)Topline: A Manhattan federal judge voided a Trump administration “conscience” rule Wednesday that would allow healthcare workers to refuse performing procedures such as abortions or sterilizations on religious or moral grounds. 
Surprising fact: One in six U.S. hospital patients are treated in Catholic facilities, due to a spate of mergers.
Crucial quote: In his decision, Engelmayer wrote the conscience rule “was sufficiently shot through with glaring legal defects.”
Key background: Part of President Trump’s effort to extend additional civil rights to healthcare workers has been through redefining the concept of religious liberty. Critics say, however, that the Trump administration has weakened civil rights for patients. Trump announced the conscience rule in a May 2018 Rose Garden event for the National Day of Prayer. The Office of Civil Rights, within HHS, has been expanded during Trump’s presidency to include a conscience and freedom division, reported the New York Times.
