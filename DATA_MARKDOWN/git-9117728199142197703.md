        Alexander Albon will start the United States Grand Prix from P6. The Thai-British Red Bull driver looks back with mixed feelings on his final lap in Q3. Yet according to the Albon, P6 isn't a bad result for the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing driver. 
      
“It was okay. I made a mistake in the final round. My pace was not as good as that of the other boys, but certainly not bad," Albon reported in front of the Ziggo Sport camera. 
Jack Plooij concludes that he must be very much at the limit: “Yes, it's not easy. Max pushes a little more at the limit. It's not bad for me, because I had quite a bit of trouble in the third free practice," Albon replies.
“We have soft tires, hopefully, we can catch up with someone like Lewis at the start. Hopefully, someone will suffer from tyre degradation," said the Red Bull driver.
