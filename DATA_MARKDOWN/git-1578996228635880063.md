Longtime ELLE columnist E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump this summer of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in New York City more than 20 years ago.
In her memoir What Do We Need Men For?, she wrote that Trump asked her to help him pick out a gift for "a girl" in the store's lingerie section in late 1995 or early 1996. Inside a dressing room, she wrote, Trump penetrated her before she was able to "get a knee up high enough to push him out and off."
Trump denied the allegations. In fact, he denied ever meeting Carroll, despite a photo of them together from the '80s. “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type," he told The Hill. "Number two, it never happened. It never happened, okay?”
On Monday, Carroll announced she's suing Trump for defamation, claiming the president damaged her reputation and career when he denied the allegations. According to the lawsuit, his response was, "fully consistent with his tried-and-true playbook for responding to credible public reports that he sexually assaulted women.”
