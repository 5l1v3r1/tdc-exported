According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Academy has rejected director Genevieve Nnanji’s Lionheart, Nigeria’s entry for this year’s Best International Feature Film award, for its predominantly English dialogue. However, as many on social media have pointed out, including When They See Us director Ava DuVernay, English is Nigeria’s official language. In its attempt to encourage foreign language films, they ask, is the Academy penalizing international filmmakers operating in their country’s most commonly spoken language?
