Virginia jam festival Lockn’ usually happens in August, but it’s moving to June in 2020 and also doubling as an 80th birthday celebration for Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. The news broke in an ad in a print issue of C-Ville Weekly, which reveals that the fest goes down June 21-21 at Infinity Downs Farm in Arrington with a probably-Grateful-Dead-themed “Steal Your Thursday” happening right beforehand. Tickets go on sale Friday (11/8) at 8:08 AM Eastern.
Stay tuned for the lineup. Here’s a photo of that print ad:
