NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal is back in the Indian setup and that means that another episode of Chahal TV is out. This time, he interviewed Mumbai lads Shreyas Iyer and Shivam Dube while standing on a chair at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi where India will play Bangladesh in the first T20I of the three-match series on Sunday.
Chahal introduced his interviewees, who were both significantly taller than him, before glancing at the pair. He then pulled a chair from behind the camera and stood on it to make up for the height difference. "Now it is fine or else these two will make my back hurt," he said.
He asked Dube for his thoughts on the match, which would mark the 26-year-old's debut for the national team. "I just want to continue performing well. I am playing for the country now so it is a very proud moment. There will be more eyes on me and so I need to work hard and continue the good work," he said.
