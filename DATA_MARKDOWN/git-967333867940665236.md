        The local sheriff’s office said in a statement that the man shot by deputies was apparently set on committing a so-called suicide by cop and essentially forced the hand of the responding lawmen during the incident.
      
A 29-year old Florida resident named Michael Kifer ended up losing his life in an altercation with Indian River County Sheriff’s deputies which took place at his residence.
According to Miami Herald, the deputies arrived at Kifer’s home on 1 November, learning that he apparently was armed with a knife and "threatening to hurt someone over the phone".
Seeing the approaching lawmen, Kifer started to run, eventually taking shelter in his house, and after several attempts to talk to him, the deputies called in the SWAT.
All attempts to subdue the man via non-lethal means failed, the newspaper notes, as Kifer managed to endure the effect of several beanbag and tazer rounds fired at him by SWAT and deputies.
Eventually, one of the deputies shot Kifer with live ammo after the latter attempted to charge him; Kifer was then rushed to Lawnwood Regional Medical Center where he died from his injuries early on 2 November.
