KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The Xiaomi Watch is set to launch soon, with the smartwatch expected to be announced on November 5 in China alongside the Xiaomi CC9 Pro.
Not much is known about the watch beyond its uncanny resemblance to the Apple Watch, but it appears that the Xiaomi Watch (or perhaps the Mi Watch globally) will run on a scaled down version of MIUI — Xiaomi’s skin for its smartphones.
