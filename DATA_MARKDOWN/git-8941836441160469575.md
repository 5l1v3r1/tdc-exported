MILLSBORO, Del. (AP) - A Delaware man has been arrested after an 11-year-old overdosed on heroin.
State police say 31-year-old Gilbert Dickerson was charged last week with offenses including possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.
News outlets report troopers responded Oct. 28 to a report of a child in cardiac arrest and found several small bags of heroin in the child’s pocket. A Friday police statement says about 30 bags were collected from the scene, and the child was hospitalized. The newspaper says the child’s status was unclear as of Saturday.
Police say an investigation determined the child got the heroin from one of Dickerson’s children. They say the child had found the drug in an Altoids container in Dickerson’s car and shared it, not knowing it was heroin.
