A further $6 billion has been added to total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours and it is altcoins that are leading the gains. A big dose of Chinese FOMO boosted home grown projects there and Stellar’s coin burn is igniting them this morning, but are they destined to dump again?
Total market cap reached $253 billion a few hours ago which is the highest it has been for a week. The bigger picture shows more range bound trading but altcoins appear to be driving momentum at the moment.
The chart also indicates that daily volume has climbed almost 30% since the beginning of the week as everything looks green at the moment. Trader ‘Paddy Stash’ has noted the increase in altcoin dominance over the past week as BTC failed to top 70% and has started to decline in terms of market share.
