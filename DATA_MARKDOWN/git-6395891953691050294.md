NEW YORKÂ (AP) - Oprah Winfrey has chosen Elizabeth Strout's "Olive, Again," the follow-up to Strout's Pulitzer Prize winning "Olive Kitteridge," as her next book club read.
In a statement provided Thursday to The Associated Press, Winfrey praised Strout's plain-spoken title character for teaching us "so much about loneliness, judgment, aging, and loss." Strout's book is Winfrey's second selection for her new partnership with Apple. Her first pick, Ta-Nehisi Coates' novel "The Water Dancer," was announced in September and quickly topped the Apple and Amazon.com bestseller lists. Winfrey has boosted sales for dozens of books since she launched her first club, in 1996.
Winfrey's interview with Strout will air Jan. 17 on Apple TV+.
