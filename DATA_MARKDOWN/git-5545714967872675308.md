Ubisoft is bringing another quartet of WWE Superstars to the roster of multiplayer fighting title Brawlhalla. The four new ring-rockers are available to pick up in Blue Mammoth's Smash-like game today for 300 "Mammoth Coins" each.These roster additions include the hard-punching Roman Reigns, current Women's Tag Team Champion Asuka, and legendary WWE Superstars The Undertaker and "Macho Man" Randy Savage, (don't do the impression). The new wrasslers join the previously released quartet of John Cena, The Rock, Xavier Woods and Becky Lynch.No doubt this news will bring a squee of delight to Asuka herself, given The Empress of Tomorrow's personal fondness for video games. Also returning is the limited time "Brawldown" event, which includes a wrestling ring complete with crazy rope physics and breakable tables, for all your wistful Dudley Boyz memories.
