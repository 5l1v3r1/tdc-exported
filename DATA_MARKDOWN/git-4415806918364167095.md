Torrential rain has led to flooded roads and cancelled train services in parts of the north of England.
Residents were evacuated from 35 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, following a mudslide caused by heavy rain, as persistent downpours battered Yorkshire and the north Midlands.
Nottinghamshire Police said officers were called to Bank End Close alongside the fire service and Mansfield District Council just before 5pm today following concerns for the safety of people living in the houses.
Sheffield was one of the worst-hit places with a number of roads left impassable to traffic, cars stranded in floodwater and gridlock resulting on many routes.
Concerns have been raised about the levels of rivers running through the city, with the city council closing Millhouses Park, where a 14-year-old boy was swept to his death in the River Sheaf during the devastating floods inÂ the city in 2007.
The Meadowhall Shopping Centre, which was also flooded in 2007, said its Christmas Live event, was forced to cancel its Christmas Live event which was expected to be attended by thousands of people this evening.
