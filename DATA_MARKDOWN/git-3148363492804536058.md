In an address broadcast on state television, Maduro said his regime was hoping to “invoke the spirit of Baby Jesus” throughout the Christmas season.
“This is a month of peace, a month of love and we wanted to invoke the spirit of the baby Jesus, the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of God, so that he may bless our country in these 60 days that remain until 2019,” Maduro said.
