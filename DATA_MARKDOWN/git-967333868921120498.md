        The House Intelligence Committee, which is heading up the impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump, released on Thursday the transcript of its October 15 interview with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent.
      
“The testimony of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent strongly corroborates testimony from numerous other witnesses," the trio of committee chairs heading up the impeachment inquiry in the House said in a Thursday press release. "Mr. Kent affirms that he and his colleagues recognized the impropriety of pressuring Ukrainian officials to undertake politically-motivated investigations to help President Trump’s reelection prospects in 2020."
The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees are leading an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a July 25 phone call between Trump Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and whether or not Trump sought an illegal "quid pro quo" from Kiev by threatening to withhold military aid unless an investigation of former US Vice President Joe Biden was opened.
In 2016, when Biden was still in office, he, too, pressured Kiev with the threat of withholding aid - this time in order to get then-Special Prosecutor Vyktor Shokin fired, ending an anti-corruption probe into the gas company Burisma, on the board of which Biden's son, Hunter, sat at the time.
