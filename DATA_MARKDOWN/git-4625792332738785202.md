A new survey found that 98% of Americans of Latin American descent prefer terms other than "Latinx" to describe themselves.
The poll, conducted by researchers at the Hispanic market research company, ThinkNow, revealed that 44% of people of Latin American descent prefer the term "Hispanic" and 24% prefer the term "Latino" or "Latina," while another 11% wanted to be referred to by their country of origin.
Three times as many said they preferred to be called "American" in comparison to the 2% who preferred the term "Latinx." Even young Latin Americans do not prefer the term, with only 3% of the 18-34 year-old demographic saying they wanted to be described that way. Not a single person in the 508-person study over the age of 50 described themselves as "Latinx."
