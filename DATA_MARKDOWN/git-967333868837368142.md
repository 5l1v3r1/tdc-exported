        The use of the face of an angry Swedish teenage activist is intended to discourage Israeli employees from using disposable plates and cutlery, although it is not known whether the campaign has been successful.
      
Images of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, notorious for her aggressively passionate speech on the danger of climate change to the planet’s younger generation, were placed across Israel, on water coolers and in cafeterias, in what appears to be a movement to discourage the use of disposable plastic plates and cutlery, Haaretz reported Monday.
Photos of Thunberg’s angry face displayed near disposable plastic  supplies in Israel were circulated on social media, going viral and sparking a phenomenon Haaretz dubbed “Greta shaming,” implying that a feeling of shame for using non-recyclable items will cause consumers to switch to recyclables.
