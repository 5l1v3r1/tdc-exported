Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan slammed a county official’s decision to ban pro-police artwork from a county facility.
James Shelton and his son, Forrest Shelton, designed wooden “thin blue line” flags to honor police officers as part of National First Responder’s Day. The pair delivered the signs to a Montgomery County building in Germantown, Maryland.
The police station posted a photograph of the artwork on social media, but the post soon received several comments accusing the county of racism for touting the artwork.
On Saturday, Montgomery County executive Marc Elrich demanded the wooden flag be removed from the building.
"The flag provides a symbol of support to some, but it is a symbol of dismissiveness to others. Because it is divisive, the flag will not be posted at the 5th District nor in any public space within the Police Department," he said in a statement to WJLA.
