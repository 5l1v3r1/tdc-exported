Aston Villa slipped to a second Premier League defeat in a row on Saturday, losing 2-1 to Liverpool at Villa Park.
Jurgen Klopp's side needed late goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane to keep up their unbeaten run in the League and ensure they escaped from B6 with all three points.
It wasn't all plain sailing for the Reds, though, with Mahmoud Trezeguet netting his first goal for the club on the 21st minute to set up a nervy finale.
In the end the Villans couldn't hold out and that result leaves them in 16th place in the Premier League table after 14 matches of the season.
Â 
The table is starting to shape up now and as far as avoiding relegation is concerned, Villa have 11 points to their name.
That is three more than Southampton in the final relegation spot (18th).
Watford are bottom of the League on five points while, remarkably, just six points separate Villa from Arsenal in fifth place.

        Here are the latest relegation odds...
      
Norwich City - 1/3
Watford - 4/5
Newcastle United - 13/8
Southampton - 2/1

        Aston Villa - 12/5
      
Burnley - 16/5
Sheffield United - 9/2
Brighton & Hove Albion - 13/2
