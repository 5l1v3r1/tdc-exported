The 16-year-old made it from Sweden to California by yacht, train and electric car before Chile’s government announced it was canning the summit because of political unrest in the South American nation.
The COP25 summit will now be held in Spain and she is pleading for public help to make the 6000-mile trip through carbon-free modes of transportation.
“As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help,” Ms Thunberg tweeted from Los Angeles.
“It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way.”
“Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.”
