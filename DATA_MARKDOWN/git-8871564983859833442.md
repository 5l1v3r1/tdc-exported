A story about a girl’s sexual naiveté prompted a discussion about the importance of sex education in Indonesia recently, because apparently she didn’t know what semen was.
A tweet by user @CatGoldwynMyr showed screenshots of a WhatsApp chat between a doctor and an acquaintance. In the chat, the doctor tells the story about a female teenage patient who admitted to have had sexual relations with her boyfriend. 
However, these aren’t sexual relations in the usual sense. According to the girl, her boyfriend told her that he suffers from having an excess of white blood cells, and the only way to get them out was through his penis. Oblivious to the fact that it was actually semen, the girl said she helped her boyfriend in any way she can because he would appear like “he was dying, really pale because of the excess white blood cells.”
