BTS's V did it again. After his last and phenomenal performance of Singularity for the Speak Yourself Tour: The Final, he went viral for his similarities with Howl from the animation “Howl’s Moving Castle”. He also earned the new nicknames Black Swan, Fallen Angel, and Hades. Now fans are demanding a live-action movie with BTS V as the lead character.
