        New Delhi (Sputnik): The Supreme Court of India is expected to give its ruling in the politically-sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case before 17 November, as Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, who is heading the Constitutional Bench in the matter, will demit from office on that day.
      
A parody Twitter account attributed to Lord Ram, one of the incarnations of the Hindu Trinity Lord Vishnu, has taken a dig at current affairs around the legendary city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh with a pinch of salt.
Twitter bio of Bhagwan Shri Ram, who identifies as the supreme being, reads Shri Ramchandra, the seventh avatar (incarnation) of the Lord Vishnu. The location for the account is Vaikunth, a heavenly abode of the lord as per Hindu mythology.

        TWEET: "You are finding me in temple and mosque but I am waiting for you here on Twitter."
