WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (Nov 6) said he had hosted successful talks in the White House with representatives of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on a controversial dam being built on the Nile.
Trump was mediating in a dispute over Ethiopia's construction of the huge dam which Egypt says could drastically disrupt the Nile, the river providing 90 per cent of the country's drinking water.
Ethiopia says the US$4 billion hydro-electric barrage is necessary to provide much-needed electricity.
"Just had a meeting with top representatives from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan to help solve their long running dispute on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, one of the largest in the world," Trump tweeted.
"The meeting went well and discussions will continue during the day!" he added.
