The Ocean’s Thirteen star provided a series of unfounded statements on Twitter Sunday, driven by Hill’s recent departure from Congress.
“A rapist is a Supreme Court judge. A serial sexual assaulter is the president. The first person to be investigated under Congress’ new ‘no sex with staff’ rule is a woman, Rep Katie Hill,” Ellen Barkin said, alongside the hashtag “#Amerikkka2019.”
