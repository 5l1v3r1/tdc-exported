Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on Friday introduced a bill banning the use of facial recognition technology in public housing, mirroring legislation proposed in the House in July. The Hill reports: The No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act would block the tech from being installed in housing units that receive funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). "Using facial recognition technology in public housing without fully understanding its flaws and privacy implications seriously harms our most vulnerable communities," Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate, said in a statement. "Facial recognition technology has been repeatedly shown to be incomplete and inaccurate, regularly targeting and misidentifying women and people of color. We need better safeguards and more research before we test this emerging technology on those who live in public housing and risk their privacy, safety, and peace of mind." There is currently no federal law dictating when, how, where or why facial recognition technology can be used.
