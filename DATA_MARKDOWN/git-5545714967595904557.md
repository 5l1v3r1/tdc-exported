We are just a few days away from the launch of Death Stranding. The reviews are now out, the fog of obscurity has lifted ever-so-slightly, and soon we'll all be able to check out the weird world Hideo Kojima and his team have been building for ourselves.But in case you wanted one final shovelful of fuel for the hype engine, a special "Countdown to Death Stranding" live stream is to be held on November 7, one day before the esoteric adventure game's release. Hosted by Geoff Keighley (who himself features in-game as an NPC), the stream will look at Death Stranding in action and speak with both Kojima and several other actors who appear in the star-studded title.If you want to check out the action, the tune into the PlayStation YouTube channel on Thursday, November 7 at 07:00 PT / 10:00 ET / 16:00. If you like what you see, then you can pick up a copy of Death Stranding when it launches on PS4 the following day, with a PC port to follow in 2020.
