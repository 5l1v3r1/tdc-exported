Frank Ocean hasn’t played live since 2017, though he’s been talking about a new album and rolling out new music (including at his new DJ night in NYC), so we are expecting and hoping he’ll return to the stage soon. As far as we know, absolutely nothing is confirmed, but Primavera Sound director Gabi Ruiz said in a recent Reddit Q&A that he might be the secret headliner at Tyler the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival this weekend, and that he’s planning to tour the US in 2020 and end at Coachella. He’s also been heavily rumored for Coachella on the r/Coachella subreddit, and a recent update to the Coachella 2020: Confirmed, Predictions, and Outs thread says that “a very reliable source” says Frank and Travis Scott are both playing.
The only confirmed artist so far is Rage Against the Machine, and we also know from a Billboard interview with Goldenvoice president and CEO and Coachella co-founder Paul Tollett that the festival is “95% booked.”
Some have also wondered if Goldenvoice presenting My Chemical Romance’s first reunion show means they are playing too. Again, these are all guesses and rumors. Stay tuned!
