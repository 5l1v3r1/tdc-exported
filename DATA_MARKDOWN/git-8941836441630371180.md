NEW YORK (AP) - A Harvard law professor says a woman who went public with claims she was a teenage victim of Jeffrey Epstein and then sued him has damaged his reputation, business and health.
Alan Dershowitz described his anguish in a defamation counterclaim filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court against Virginia Roberts Giuffre.
Giuffre has said Epstein trafficked her to several prominent men, including Dershowitz. Dershowitz says it never happened and she has fabricated allegations and “far-fetched stories” against others.
He says he has travel records, credit card statements and phone records proving he was never in places when Giuffre claims to have had sex with him.
He says the false claims have led him to suffer severe emotion distress, including “cardiac conditions.”
A message was left with Giuffre’s lawyers for comment.
Dershowitz is seeking unspecified damages.
