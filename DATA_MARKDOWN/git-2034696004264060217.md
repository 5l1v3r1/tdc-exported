        "I didn't have the time for it"
      
Martin Scorsese has revealed that he did not get involved in Joker for “personal reasons”.
The Irishman director, who was previously reported to have considered directing the movie in its early stages, spoke about his involvement in a new interview.
Responding to a question about whether he considered the DC movie a theme park in light of his recent comments about Marvel movies, Scorsese told the BBC: “I don’t know about that, and I know the film very well, and I know [director] Todd [Phillips] very well. My producer, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, produced it.
