Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is here at last, or should I say, again. I bloody hate Call of Duty, it’s one of the most worn-out and under-innovative series out there in my opinion. However, back in 2007, it was quite possibly one of the greatest gaming experiences I ever had. A fantastic single-player campaign that I don’t think the series has ever managed to top. When they revealed that it would be getting remastered, I finally found myself giving half a crap about the franchise for the first time in a decade.
Of course, this being a remaster, it has had its fair share of improvements along the way. Completely overhauled graphics and textures bring it up to the standards of modern PC gamers. Unlocked refresh rates, HDR, higher resolutions, multi-monitor support, 21:9 support, Ansel and much more. What’s more, Nvidia really put the muscle into implementing Ray Traced Shadows into the game, helping boost the realism even further. Of course, since RTX cards are the only ray traced accelerator cards out there right now, they’re the ones we’ll be putting to the test.
