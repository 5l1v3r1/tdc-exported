MADISON, Wis. - City of Madison officials are inviting the community to a Home Safety Night event Nov. 19 at American Family DreambankÂ to share safety tips and information about how to make homes less appealing to would-be criminals.
The night will feature crime-prevention tips, ideas and resources and information about low-cost technology like smart locks, lights, sensors and video doorbells that can help make a home or property more secure.
Madison police will also have a K-9 team at the event that will share information on how the Good Neighbor Project can help neighborhoods partner with the Madison Police Department.
