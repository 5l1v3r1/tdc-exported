With its triple camera design, it’s little secret that one of the main key selling points of the brand new Apple iPhone 11 is its ability to take some pretty amazing pictures. A team from Video Village has, however, shown that it’s also more than good enough to take some pretty amazing film footage too.
How have they decided to show this though? Well, by recreating one of the most iconic scenes from the classic horror movie franchise ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’.
