Netizens are speculating whether Big Bang will make a comeback as a group.YG Entertainment released a statement on the 4th confirming that Big Bang members Taeyang and Daesung will be discharged from the military on the 10th following G Dragon's discharge on October 26th. GD recently began promotions with a brand pictorial after his release and had previously stated at his discharge ceremony that "he will be going back to his main job as a singer."The group has been under controversy this year due to 'Burning Sun Gate' that led to member Seungri not only leaving the group but also ending his contract with YG Entertainment. Seungri and Yang Hyun Suk have also been under controversy for illegal gambling activities abroad and alleged prostitution that led to Yang Hyun Suk stepping down as the executive producer. T.O.P who also recently completed his military duties, was indicted for smoking marijuana in June 2017 and had to delay his military enlistment.Many are curious whether the members will comeback with solo promotions as well as a group comeback as "four" following Seungri's departure.
