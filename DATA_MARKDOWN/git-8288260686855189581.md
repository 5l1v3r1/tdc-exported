A woman and a girl were injured when a car overturned in a car crash in Sparkbrook.
The pair were travelling on Ladypool Road when they were involved in a crash with another vehicle at the junction of Highgate Road , just after 12.40pm on Monday.
All of the emergency services were called to the scene but luckily the woman and girl only suffered minor injuries and were discharged at the roadside.
A spokesman from West Midlands Ambulance Service said: “We were called to reports of an overturned car. One ambulance attended. We treated a woman and a girl for minor injuries and they were discharged at the scene.”
A spokesman from West Midlands Fire Service said they sent an appliance from Erdington and a crew from Fallings Park, who happened to be passing through, also stopped to offer their assistance.
A video shows a silver car on its side with police around. The road was restricted while crews dealt with the cars.
