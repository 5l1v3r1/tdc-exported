        A newly leaked lyric from what appears to be an old Eminem track suggests the rapper sided with Chris Brown after he assaulted Rihanna in 2009.

The snippet seems to be part of an unreleased version of B.o.B.’s 2011 track Things Get Worse, and has been doing the rounds on social media in recent days.
Chris Brown ultimately pleaded guilty for his actions, admitting he ‘felt like a f*cking monster’ after a picture of the singer’s battered face circulated worldwide – yet Eminem’s apparent leaked lyrics appear to place him firmly on his side.

The lyrics were apparently leaked when a Reddit user posted a seven-second snippet – titled ‘(SNIPPET) Eminem – Things Get Worse (Rihanna Diss)’ – of an unreleased version of B.o.B.’s song, according to Insider.
The version of the song that did get released didn’t mention Chris Brown or Rihanna – but did include multiple references to female celebrities being sexually abused and murdered.

        In the short leaked snippet, Eminem can be heard rapping – between voice-overs meant to prevent copyright infringement:
      
It’s not possible to link to the clip as the lyrics appear to have been illegally obtained, however the lyric in question has been making the rounds on Twitter since.
