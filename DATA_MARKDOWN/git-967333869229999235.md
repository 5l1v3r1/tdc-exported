        Conan is the nickname of a military dog which took part in and was injured during the US military operation in north Syria against the leader and founder of Daesh* Abu al-Baghdadi that resulted in his death on 26 October.
      
US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday in a political campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana, that Conan would attend the White House ‘very soon’.
Trump called the dog, which he claims got injured while taking down Daesh’s leader al-Baghdadi, a great hero.
While celebrating the dog’s heroism, Trump sent a message to the fighters of the terrorist group, whom he referred to as ‘bloodthirsty savages’, that they “don't stand a chance against the might of the United States military”
On 27 October, Trump announced that Daesh* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in a raid executed by US Special Operations Forces in Syria’s Idlib province.

        *Daesh (ISIS, ISIL, IS, Islamic State) is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries.
