Nature has evolved considerably since its first issue in 1869. To chart the changes, we analysed our archive. The number of scientific publications — which we defined mainly as letters and articles — rose quickly in the late 1950s and then dropped as editorial practices changed. Research contributions early on ranged more evenly across academic disciplines, but biomedical sciences have gained prominence over the past century. Over the years, author lists have grown, as have the proportion of female authors and the number of countries publishing in Nature.
