In contrast, only 26 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of independents say they would back someone who describes themselves as a Democratic Socialist.
The Hill reported on its poll, which the media outlet said comes after a number of far left candidates were elected to Congress in 2018, including the Squad — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA):
The Hill noted that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is the only one running for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination who has embraced that title and has defended his ideology as carrying on the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt “New Deal,” redistribution of wealth model.
The Hill-HarrisX online survey asked questions of 523 registered voters between Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. The margin of error for the full sampling is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
