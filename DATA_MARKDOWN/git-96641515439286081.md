Adobe has revealed a lot more experimental tools -- or "sneaks," as what the company calls it -- other than Project Awesome Audio at this year's MAX conference. One of them is Project All in, and it could be the answer to your woes if you're always the designated photographer or don't have a tripod and a camera with a timer. The tool, powered by the Adobe Sensei AI engine, can scan two photos, identify the missing person in one of them and then add a cutout of that person to the other photo.
Sure, you can also do that with the lasso tool in Photoshop, but All in would make the process so much easier. It could make awkwardly posing like you have your arms around your significant other for cut-and-paste couple photos almost bearable.
