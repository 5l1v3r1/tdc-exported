        Is it all kicking off again?
      
Robbie Williams has taken aim at Liam Gallagher, saying he should “buy yourself a pair of bollocks”.
The former Take That singer today (November 7) responded to a tweet that Gallagher posted earlier this week in which he said he “big fuck off fish to fry”. Williams wrote: “While your [sic] out buy yourself a pair of bollocks.”
