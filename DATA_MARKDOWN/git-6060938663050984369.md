BHUBANESWAR: Odisha has been the traditional hotbed of Indian hockey, and it's not just restricted to men. The state has been a nursery for the women's national team as well, but never before have the locals had the chance to root for the women in large numbers.
The Olympic qualifying event against USA, beginning Friday, provides them that long overdue chance. In front of a capacity 15,000 crowd expected in the Kalinga Stadium stands, it's going to be a home experience like never before for the Indian women's team.
Though it's not for the first time that the India women are playing Olympic qualifiers at home, it's going to be different on more than one count, compared to 2012 in Delhi, because (1) the focus on women's hockey has grown since qualification for 2016 Rio Olympics, (2) the team has improved considerably in the last four years, (3) they have never before played in a jam-packed stadium and (4) the team has to prove that the 4-29 win-loss record against the Americans doesn't reflect India's growing stature in women's hockey accurately.
