Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX sent a mass email to its users on Friday with all of their email addresses in the “To” field. Usually, when you are sending a mass e-mail and you want to protect other users’ privacy, you put their e-mail addresses in the so-called blind carbon copy or BCC field. That’s how the other users’ e-mail addresses stay hidden from everybody else. This way, by not putting the names in the BCC field but in an amateurish manner dividing them by the comma, BitMEX directly affected its users’ privacy.
Confirming the issue, BitMEX announced on Friday that it is “aware that some of our users have received a general user update email earlier today, which contained the email addresses of other users,” adding that their “team have acted immediately to contain the issue and we are taking steps to understand the extent of the impact. Rest assured that we are doing everything we can to identify the root cause of the fault and we will be in touch with any users affected by the issue”.
“The privacy of our users is a top priority and we are very sorry for the concern this has caused to our users,” highlights the team.
