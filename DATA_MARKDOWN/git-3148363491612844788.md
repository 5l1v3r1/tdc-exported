“Sweetheart, that’s a compliment for me,” reacted Shatner on Wednesday, in response to a Twitter user named Billie E., who tweeted the “OK Boomer” catchphrase at him.
The 88-year-old Star Trek actor is not a member of the Baby Boomer generation, but rather, the Silent Generation, who were born roughly between the years 1928 and 1945.
