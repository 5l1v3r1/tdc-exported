A custom technical signal that has predicted Bitcoin’s price trends to a tee over the past six weeks is printing a buy, implying that BTC may soon mount higher. The indicator doesn’t show where Bitcoin is headed, but there are some analysts expecting the cryptocurrency to reenter the $10,000 range in coming trading sessions.
Over the past few days, BTC has found itself consolidating in the low-$9,000s, failing to establish a trend in any which direction. As of the time of writing this article, the cryptocurrency is changing hands for $9,190, down some 0.5% on the day.
