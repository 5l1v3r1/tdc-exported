Facebook now has a new flat logo to separate itself from its products. The new Facebook logo distinguishes the Facebook company from the Facebook app. The new Facebook logo has a different font than the one they use for their apps. There’s a GIF that rotates between their various brand assets colour schemes – Blue is for Facebook, green is for WhatsApp, pink-orange is for Instagram.
People on Twitter expressed their opinions about the new Facebook logo and we’re here for it.
