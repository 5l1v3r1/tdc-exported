        New Delhi (Sputnik): Just weeks after Tik Tok user Hareem Shah hogged headlines by occupying the Pakistani prime minister’s chair in the Foreign Ministry, a man has allegedly conned numerous politicians by impersonating a BBC reporter.
      
A man allegedly pretending to be a journalist from the British public broadcaster BBC has come under fire after being busted by a journalist on Twitter.
The man, who is yet to be identified, is said to have interviewed several senior Pakistani ministers while wearing a fake identity card and carrying a mic with a BBC World News logo on it.
The man sporting long hair pretended to be a BBC Italy reporter, while interviewing former Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
After the pictures of him appeared on the internet, a BBC Urdu journalist Tahir Imran Mian called his bluff by pointing out: “...this guy is an imposter who pretends to be a BBC journalist. He is not a BBC employ [sic]”.
