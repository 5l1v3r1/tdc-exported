Donald Trump is in attendance at UFC 244, with the US President walking to his seat prior to the start of the pay-per-view portion of the event. Trump got notoriously booed attending a World Series game, but he did get mixed reactions from the crowd during this MMA event.
As he was slowly walking to his seat, Trump was heavily booed by the crowd.
