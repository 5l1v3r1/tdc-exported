DETROIT (AP) - The Detroit Lions have ruled out defensive back Tracy Walker for Sunday’s game at Oakland because of a knee injury.
Defensive tackle Mike Daniels (foot) is doubtful, and cornerback Darius Slay (hamstring) is questionable. The team said Slay was a full participant in practice Friday.
Daniels has missed the past four games, and Slay missed last weekend’s win over the New York Giants.
Walker was hurt in that game against New York.
Running back Tra Carson (hamstring), offensive lineman Graham Glasgow (back), defensive tackle Damon Harrison (groin), cornerback Amani Oruwariye (knee) and defensive tackle A’Shawn Robinson (ankle) are questionable.
