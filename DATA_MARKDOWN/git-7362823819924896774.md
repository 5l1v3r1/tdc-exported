The scope of the damage from California's Kincade Fire can be seen from space in a disturbing new satellite image.
The newly released image was taken on Sunday by NASA's Terra satellite, according to the space agency's press release.
That satellite is equipped with a special instrument that harnesses thermal infrared channels to detect heat on the Earth's surface.

The dark grey shows burnt areas, and the yellow dots show smoldering fires, according to NASA.
