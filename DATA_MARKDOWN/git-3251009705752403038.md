Diwali, which is one of the biggest festivals in India, is celebrated ecstatically every year. Also known as the festival of lights, many celebrate it by bursting crackers.
In recent wake to the pollution, the state governments and courts in India had set deadlines and set time windows to burst crackers. However, many were found flouting it.
That’s not it, a video from Uttar Pradesh shows cracker bursting from a moving vehicle.
The video, which has become viral on the Internet shows a moving Honda City on the empty roads. The video, which has been taken from behind the vehicle shows sky shooters and rockets being fired from inside the car through the sunroof of the moving vehicle.
The small video shows several firecrackers being burst by the occupants of the Honda City on the move.
