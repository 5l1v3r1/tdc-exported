        One thing that the big bitcoin bull run of 2017 has taught many of us is how to hodl. There are now way more people holding BTC than there were just two years ago and this trend is set to continue. Holding just a small amount may be life changing in the next decade or two.
      
With over 18 million bitcoins now in circulation and the halving rapidly approaching, supply and demand is going to come into play more than ever in the next few years. It has been suggested by industry experts that anyone delving into crypto markets should hold at least one BTC.
Bitcoin pioneer and host Charlie Shrem has taken this a bit further and estimates that 5-10 BTC will be life changing in twenty yearsâ€™ time.
