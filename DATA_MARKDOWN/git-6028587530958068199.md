Topline: A judge ordered President Donald Trump on Thursday to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit accusing him and his family of misusing funds from the now-shuttered Trump Foundation to further his political interests, confirming previous reporting about financial mismanagement related to Trump and his charities.
Key background: Six months after the lawsuit was filed, the Trump Foundation shut its doors. Charities belonging to Trump and his family, including Trump’s children Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, have also been scrutinized for self-dealing and financial impropriety. Forbes reported in 2017 that the Trump Foundation apparently used a separate charity started by Eric Trump to funnel $100,000 in donations into revenue for the Trump Organization, the family’s real estate business.
Tangent: Here is how Forbes calculated Trump’s net worth, which sits at $3.1 billion.
