WWE is a media empire, with fingers and toes in every piehole and crevice of the entertainment industry. This means that every now and then, their production leg, WWE Studios, teams up with companies like Sony and Warner Bros. to make strange movie magic. And this is how we get very weird movie gems like Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery, a John Cena-starring Scooby Doo movie.
Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery was the first in a long and very strange line of WWE x Warner Bros. animated crossovers, and was unleashed upon this Earth in 2014. This delightful crossover featured WWE wrestlers teaming up with the cast of Scooby-Doo! to uncover the mystery of a "Ghost Bear" after it steals the WWE Championship right before WrestleMania.
Also, John Cena rescues the gang from a giant, Temple of Doom-style boulder.
