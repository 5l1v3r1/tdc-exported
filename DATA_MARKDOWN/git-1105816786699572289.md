In a recent turn of events, Rabi Pirzada’s videos were compromised and hashtag #RabiPirzada was trending on social media with Twitterati heavily criticising the breach of privacy.
“The vile campaign against Rabi Pirzada is a stark reminder of how privacy is violated to blackmail women into submission. Morality is used to justify such abhorrent campaigns whereas people leaking such footage hide behind societal norms. They should be behind bars,” stated the international public policy and gender reforms specialist Salman Sufi.
