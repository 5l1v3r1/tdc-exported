US Rapper TI made a shocking revelation in an interview wherein he stated that he takes his teenage daughter to the gynecologist each year to check if her hymen is “still intact”. According to an international news portal, TI went on to talk about parenting and that’s when he revealed that he has had ‘the sex talk’ with his daughter 18-year-old daughter, Deyjah Harris, who is in her first year of college. He reportedly stated that he takes his daughter to the gynecologist every year and that after her 16th birthday party, he put a sticky note on the door which read, “Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30."
TI, whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr, went on to detail that his daughter also signs a document so that her medical information can be shared with him. TI stated that he has been informed that hymen can be broken in ways other than through sexual penetration, like riding horses and bikes, but he stated his daughter doesn’t indulge in any of these activities and as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.
Several social media users criticized TI for his comments and lashed out on Twitter.
