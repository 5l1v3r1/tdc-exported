Topline: Gert Boyle, the longtime chairman of Columbia Sportswear, died Sunday in Portland, Oregon, the company said. The refugee from Nazi Germany, who starred in Columbia’s iconic “One Tough Mother” ad campaign, was 95. 
Key background: When Boyle’s husband, Neal, took over Columbia in Portland from his father in 1964, he took out a loan with the Small Business Administration using their house, vacation home, Boyle’s mother’s house and life insurance as collateral. After he died, the only option for Boyle was to take over the businesses with her son, Tim, who still had a year left at the University of Oregon. 
Within the first two years, they almost ran the business into the ground, with sales decreasing 25% to $600,000 during the first year. A buyer offered just $1,400 for the business at the time, and in turning it down, Boyle her son recommitted to building the business. 
Since then, Columbia has grown to a recognizable sportswear brand with a $6.25 billion market cap. It went public in 1998 and now has 7,800 employees worldwide.
