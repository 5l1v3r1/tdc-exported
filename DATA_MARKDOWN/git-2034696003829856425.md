        It's not been cancelled yet...
      
The government is still reportedly pushing ahead with plans for a controversial post-Brexit festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, despite Boris Johnson being urged to drop it.
The event, which was first touted under Theresa May’s government, was described as a showcase for “the UK’s unique strengths in creativity and innovation” – with comparisons to the 1951 festival of Britain.
Despite being dubbed “The festival of Brexit” by critics,  The Guardian reports that Dean Creamer, a delivery director for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, has been tasked with planning the £120m project.
Set to take place in 2022, the event will reportedly deliver an “exciting programme” of arts, culture, design and technology in the same year as the Queen’s platinum jubilee and the 100th anniversary of the BBC.
