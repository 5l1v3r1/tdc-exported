In a small roadside café of Bangkok, a barista with Down Syndrome works hard to fight social stigma and show what people with learning disabilities can do if given a chance.
BANGKOK: Jin’s mother had dreamt of owning a cafe before she died from cancer two years ago. If she had lived, she would have beamed with pride to know that her 28-year-old son, who has Down Syndrome, is brewing up her dream, with love and precision.
Thakolrat ‘Jin’ Prongsuwan recently shot to fame after his story was shared on Thai social media. His growing popularity has transformed a once empty cafe on busy Petchburi Road into a bustling space, with many customers dropping in to get their favourite drinks and take photos with him.
