A Colorado woman was arrested after cops said she tried to shoot her neighbor with a crossbow.
Court papers say that when the neighbor opened the door to her apartment in Longmont, Colo., at 3 a.m. Friday, her downstairs neighbor Katherine Cherry “stuck a black crossbow through the door and fired an arrow at her.” KUSA-TV reports.
The document says the arrow flew down the hallway after grazing the neighbor, according to the station.

It states further that the woman said she “felt in fear of her life when she saw the crossbow,” the station reported.
The neighbor told police she called 911 after she swung a hammer at Cherry, whom she thought “was crazy,” according to KUSA.
