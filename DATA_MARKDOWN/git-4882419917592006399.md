Riqui Puig spoke on Sunday after Barcelona B's draw with Andorra at the Johan Cruyff stadium and said he wants more protagonism at the club.
"I'd like to have more minutes (up a level) and if I see I won't get them I'll have to take a decision," he said in the mixed zone.
"In theory I didn't plan to leave on loan in the winter window, but we'll see."
The player also thinks that opponents use excessive force when trying to stop him. "This year there have been a lot of cases when the have come for me, I don't know if it's at club level or federation (RFEF) but they have to do something, because one day I'll end up injured."
