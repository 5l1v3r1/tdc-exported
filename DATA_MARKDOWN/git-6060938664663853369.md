Nick Jonas shares a close bond with his brothers Joe Jonas and Kevin Jonas. Apart from their band concerts, they are often seen celebrating festivals and taking off on vacations together. Kevin Jonas turned a year older yesterday and Nick took to his Instagram handle to share the sweetest message for his big brother. He shared a quirky picture on his picture sharing app where Nick can be seen shoving Kevin’s head into a wall while Joe is standing behind them.
She captioned the funny picture as, ‘Happy birthday to my older bro @kevinjonas this is me playfully pushing his head into a wall. Seemed like the appropriate photo to share on his birthday. Love you man.’
Their respective better halves also get along with each other very well. Danielle Jonas, Sophie Turner and Priyanka Chopra are also seen attending Jonas Brothers’ concerts with their husbands and hanging out together.
