After spending years searching for ways to improve the longevity and resilience of stored data, Microsoft discovered the solution lies inside coaster-sized pieces of quartz glass.
Project Silica is a Microsoft Research project that uses recent discoveries in ultrafast laser optics and artificial intelligence to store data in quartz glass.
As first demonstrated by researchers from the University of Southampton Optoelectronics Research Centre; a laser encodes data in “voxels” by creating layers of three-dimensional nanoscale gratings and deformations at various depths and angles.  Machine learning algorithms then read the data back by decoding images and patterns that are created as polarized light shines through the glass.
