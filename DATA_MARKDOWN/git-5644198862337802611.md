WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Thursday (Oct 31) that he will be making Palm Beach, Florida, his permanent residence instead of his Trump Tower apartment in New York City.
Trump has owned the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach since 1985 and has spent more time there during his presidency than at his penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York.
"My family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence," Trump said on Twitter.
"Despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," he said, referring to New York.
