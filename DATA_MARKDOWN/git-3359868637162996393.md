Over the last few months, the rising tensions due to the escalating U.S.-China trade war has left global investors in worry. Several analysts have also raised fears of possible recession by the next year.
However, some of the indicators still suggest that the U.S. stock market is all poised for a massive rally before the end of 2019. In its latest article, CCN mentions some of the strong indicators that can support the market rally ahead. Some of the powerful indicators include “positive seasonality, underexposed fund managers, and strong market breadth”.
According to the research by LPL Financial, the U.S. stock market is poised for the year-end rally also called the Santa Claus rally. Moreover, with the U.S. Presidential Elections next year, this rally could be more pronounced already in the ongoing 2019. LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick explained:
Additionally, historical chart patterns show that when stocks gained over 20% in October, the coming months of November and December have produced positive gains.
