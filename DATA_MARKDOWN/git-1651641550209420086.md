Zack from JerryRigEverything has been testing phones for quite some time now and his videos are usually geared towards the durability aspect of smartphones. While extreme sometimes, his tests usually simulate the kind of abuse a smartphone might endure in its entire life.
Today, Zack shared a new video which pushes Pixel 4 XL to its limits and the phone cracked under pressure, literally. JerryRigEverything’s video gave customers another reason why they should skip the Pixel 4 XL. While Pixel 4 XL is certainly not the first device to crack, it’s one of the few flagships to not make it to the end of the test in one piece.
