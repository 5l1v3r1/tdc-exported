President Trump used Beto O’Rourke’s words from the beginning of his 2020 campaign to mock the end of his presidential bid.
In a celebratory tweet, Trump pointed to O’Rourke’s Vanity Fair campaign launch and scoffed at his campaign-ending announcement.
"Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was 'born for this.' I don’t think so!" he tweeted Friday.
