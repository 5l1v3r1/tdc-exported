The Daily Wire reported:
On Tuesday Morrissey was elected to a state senate seat winning close to 64 percent of the vote. Waylin Ross, an Independent, got 36 percent of the vote. No Republican was on the ballot.
The Daily Wire reported on Morrissey’s nefarious resumé in and outside of government:
Morrissey also ran a failed bid for Richmond mayor in 2016, according to the Daily Wire.
In 2015 Style Weekly interviewed Morrissey, who brought his girlfriend, at the time Myrna Warren, with him. She was pregnant with their second child after having their first child at 19. 
The couple are now married and have three children.
Style Weekly reported on his legal problems and the relationship that led to some of them:
WJLA reported that Morrissey will represent residents in “parts of Richmond, Chesterfield County, Petersburg, Hopewell, Prince George County, and Dinwiddie County.”
