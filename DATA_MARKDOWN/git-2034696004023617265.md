        The rising R&B singer and songwriter to the stars looks set for big solo success in 2020
      
The title of Victoria Monét’s latest single might strike fear into the hearts of thin-skinned radio producers and TV censors, but ‘Ass Like That’ is actually something of a red herring.
The smooth and infectiously catchy single seeks to promote the kind of goal-minded body positivity that can be achieved through regular exercise. “Met him about two months ago, said his name was Gym,” Monét wryly coos over the kind of rolling, groove-laden beat SZA would snap up in an instant. She later declares a preference to “treat my calories like weed, yeah, I burn that shit” in a quote that could definitely be printed on a range of Monét-approved gymwear. “It seems like people are starting to consider it as a work-out anthem,” she adds. “But this is like a chilled version, and it reflects upon my personality because I’m really chill and, in my head, some sort of hippie, just going with the wind.”
It could, as Monét herself puts it, have been an “up-tempo, 808s-heavy song that you can dance to”, instead it’s a slow and steady slice of R&B. “When I was writing the song, I was really documenting my own experiences and my life,” Monét explains to NME. “And now looking back and listening to ‘Ass Like That’, I realise that there’s a bigger purpose: subconsciously taking power into my own hands and talking about my body in the way I’d like to.”
