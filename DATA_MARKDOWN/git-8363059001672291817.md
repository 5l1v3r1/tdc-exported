Google just released a November update for Pixel phones... and there was something missing.
The original Google Pixel and Pixel XL were MIA from the device list.
After its release in October 2016, it looks like the Pixel that started it all may be finally be getting put out to pasture.
I guess Google weren't joking about providing precisely three years of updates for its devices. As 9To5Google points out, it's possible that the update has merely been delayed for these users, though considering the timing it seems unlikely.
Google's Pixel support page also lists October 2019 as the end of the original Pixel's minimum support and update period, stating they won't be guaranteed after October 2019.
If you do have an original Pixel, it is probably time to prepare for a life without Pixel-specific bug fixes or security updates.
Gizmodo has reached out to Google for confirmation regarding being dropped from the update list. [9To5Google]
