Liverpool showed title-winning credentials as they bounced back from their first slip-up of the season last week.

Villa’s only Premier League defeat in their past four outings has come to Manchester City and they booked their place in the Carabao Cup quarter finals, where they will also play Liverpool , in midweek.
