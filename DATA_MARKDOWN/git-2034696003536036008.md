Sarah Jessica-Parker appears to have confirmed that the original cast of 1993 cult comedy Hocus Pocus – Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and herself – have all agreed to star in the proposed sequel.
The former Sex and the City star posted a picture of the trio from the original film on Instagram on Friday (November 1). One fan asked the actor in the comments: ‘any chance of a sequel?!’
Jessica-Parker replied: ‘we have all said yes. Now we wait. X’
The news will come as a relief to fans of the original story, as there was previously some doubt as to whether Midler, Jessica-Parker and Najimy would appear in the new Hocus Pocus film – prompting a slew of unimpressed reactions on social media.
