Fiona Apple said she’s “hoping for early 2020″ to release a new album, and while there are no updates on that front, she has popped up in a couple of places recently. She sang “Pig Trouble in Little Tina” during the end credits to Bob’s Burgers‘ Halloween episode, and now she’s appeared in the end credits of another TV show. Showtimes’ The Affair had its series finale last night, and a cover by Fiona of The Waterboys’ 1985 classic “The Whole of the Moon” soundtracked the end credits. Listen below.
