A new report claims that the crypto exchange giant Binance’s seemingly constant expansion is a calculated effort to position itself as the biggest player in an emerging market. The author borrows the term “blitzscaling” to describe the business plan.
Although its newest efforts might not be yielding massive results yet, the authors say Binance’s expansion into just about every corner of crypto may eventually make the exchange a cornerstone of an entirely new financial system. For this reason, those penning the report say that Binance Coin (BNB) is highly undervalued.
A new report published by Multicoin Capital argues that Binance, one of the largest and easily the most diverse cryptocurrency exchange on the planet, is positioning itself to become the centre of an entirely new financial system. Author of an accompanying article to the report itself, Tushar Jain, states that although the company’s aggressive expansion might not be yielding massive results yet, the company is setting itself up to be what he describes as a “neo-bank of the future”.
