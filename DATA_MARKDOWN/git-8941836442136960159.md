KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Three Tennessee teenagers have been sentenced in the death of a 15-year-old classmate.
News outlets report 19-year-old Isaiah Trey Brooks was sentenced to 10 years in prison for reckless homicide in the death of Gibbs High School sophomore Zach Munday.
A Knox County judge on Friday also sentenced 18-year-old Chelsea Nicole Hopson to 30 days for being an accessory after the fact and 19-year-old Noel Leyva to three years’ probation for being an accessory after the fact and furnishing alcohol to a minor.
According to testimony, Leyva hosted a party in May at his parents’ home where Brooks slammed Munday into the ground. Munday was taken to Brooks’ home, but hours passed before authorities were called.
A coroner testified Munday died of blunt head trauma after days in a coma.
