One of the last places a president would want to be when his country's national team makes history in a Rugby World Cup final would be the loo. But that is where President Cyril Ramaphosa found himself after a badly timed bathroom break at the Yokohama Stadium in Japan.

In the 66th minute of the final, wing Makazole Mapimpi became the first Springbok rugby player to score a try in a World Cup final, as South Africa beat England 32-12 on Saturday to claim the Webb Ellis Cup â€“ their third in as many finals.
Ramaphosa, who was at the stadium in Japan, revealed to the Bok squad that, because of his own nerves, he had missed the first try as he made a run to the bathroom. He made the remarks as the Boks began their trophy parade at the Union Buildings on Thursday.
"During the match, I was nervous," Ramaphosa told the squad as he hosted them at the Union Buildings.
"When they scored their first try, I had gone to the 'gents' because of my nervousness," he said to a chuckling crowd.
