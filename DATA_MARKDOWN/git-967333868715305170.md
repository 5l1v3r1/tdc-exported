A Swiss football club called Servette FC has found itself facing allegations of sexism over what appears to be a risqué stunt aimed at boosting ticket sales for an upcoming match.
According to the Sun, the Geneva-based outfit triggered this storm by posting a screenshot from Pornhub on their Twitter account, depicting scantily-dressed lady ascending a staircase, with the club’s logo being visible in the background.
While this development led to angry fans bashing the club, arguing that the post might’ve been seen by children and suspecting possible sexism, club spokesman Loic Luscher insisted that they merely wanted to deal “proactively” with the video in question which, as the newspaper notes, was apparently recorded at an erotica fair in Geneva about two years ago.
The club also said in a statement that they regarded the appearance of their logo in the video as "funny" and that it makes no difference to them "whether the person in the foreground is a man or a woman."
