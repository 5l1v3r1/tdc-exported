        The England Rugby team has lost 12-32 against South Africa in the World Cup final, after being dominated in the second half.
      
South Africa played a strong game throughout, outplaying England at every turn in Yokohama. This marks a third Rugby World Cup win for South Africa, with tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe taking the Springboks to victory.
This marked the second meeting between the two teams in the tournament, with South Africa previously proving victorious in Paris 12 years ago. This also marks the very first time South Africa has had a black captain, Siya Kolisi.
