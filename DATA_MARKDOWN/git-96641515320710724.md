Two years ago, the president said the US would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, calling it "unfair." On Monday the Trump administration announced the year-long process has formally begun with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying in a statement that "Per the terms of the Agreement, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations."
