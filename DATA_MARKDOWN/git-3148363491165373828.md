The video is a parody of “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” from Charles M. Schulz’s iconic comic strip Peanuts.
In the video, Linus tells Charlie Brown that “soon the Great Pumpkin will rise out of the pumpkin patch for all to see,” only to be told by Charlie Brown that the Great Pumpkin “is not coming [as] he has been impeached.”
“What did the Great Pumpkin do?” asks Linus.
“Remember that official phone call we listened in on?” Charlie replies.
