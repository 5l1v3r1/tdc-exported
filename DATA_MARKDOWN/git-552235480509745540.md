Hibs boss Paul Heckingbottom reported "a lot of knocks" to unnamed players ahead of Saturday's Betfred Cup semi-final against Celtic.
Martin Boyle will be assessed after coming off the bench to net a late equaliser against Livingston on Wednesday on his comeback from a long-term knee problem.
Midfielder Vykintas Slivka is at a similar stage as Boyle following an ankle break but Hibs defenders Darren McGregor (abdomen) and David Gray (knee) are still out.
Celtic , meanwhile, are sweating over the fitness of skipper Scott Brown after he picked up an injury.
Mikey Johnston, however, could return to action.
