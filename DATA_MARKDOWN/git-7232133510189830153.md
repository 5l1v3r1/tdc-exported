If you’ve followed the macroeconomic or Bitcoin news cycle over the past few months, you’ve likely heard and seen the qualms of Argentina.
The South American country has been going through a bout of political and economic turmoil, which has culminated in rapidly-increasing inflation and a tumultuous stock market. In short, it is unlikely that holding Argentine pesos or local assets is sustainable. Hence, many have looked to alternative assets, like Bitcoin and U.S. dollars. But, the Central Bank of Argentina is picking up on this.
According to a report from CoinTelegraph’s Brazil branch, the nation’s central bank wrote in a recent message that purchasing cryptocurrencies with certain payments are banned. The payment method in question is credit cards, with the bank writing:
Argentina’s central bank claims that this is being done to preserve the integrity of the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
This comes shortly after the Argentinian monetary authority revealed that it will only be allowing individuals Argentinians to purchase $200 per month on the legal market. Previously, individuals were allowed to purchase up to $10,000 a month.
