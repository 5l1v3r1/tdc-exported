As handy as smart speakers can be, the fact they’re always listening can make them a little creepy — remember how smart speaker makers were caught using humans to listen to voice recordings? Now, researchers have demonstrated a potential new security risk: it’s possible to issue commands to smart speakers with lasers instead of spoken words, as Wired reports.
The researchers found that by changing a laser’s intensity to a specific frequency and pointing the laser directly at a smart speaker’s microphone, they could make the microphone interpret the laser as if it were sound, letting them issue a command to the voice assistant powering the device. And it seems like practically every voice assistant may be vulnerable to this vector of attack, as the researchers say they have tested this on Google Home devices, Amazon Alexa devices, and Facebook’s Portal Mini, as well as some smartphones including an iPhone XR, a sixth-generation iPad, a Samsung Galaxy S9, and a Google Pixel 2.
They’re calling the idea “Light Commands.” Here’s a video overview of how they work (the researchers’ website has a good explanation as well):
