South Africans woke to a morning of excitement and anticipation on Saturday as the nation rallies around the Springboks in their quest to become rugby world champions for the third time.
As the Springboks prepare to do battle with England in Japan, fans were readying their day at their respective viewing points, loading up the biltong and snacks, while street vendors sold their best merchandise at interchanges around the country.
A viral video posted on Friday shows Edgemead Primary School in Cape Town singing their heart outs, giving their best rendition of "Shosholoza!" which has been sent to the team in Japan.
"Goosebump moment at EPS! This video has been sent directly to a number of the Bokke Team! They have received it and conveyed their thanks!" a video on Facebook posted by the school said on Friday.
President Cyril Ramaphosa also met with Boks on Saturday to give them his message of support and "Vuma!"
At traffic interchanges in Cape Town, vendors were out in force selling their best Bok memorabilia.
