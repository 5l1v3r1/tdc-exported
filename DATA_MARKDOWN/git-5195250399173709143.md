Bajaj Auto has the Pulsar series at the forefront of its sales aspirations as the popular nameplate is known for garnering massive volumes consistently for several years. However, Bajaj could not guard the Pulsar range from getting affected in the ongoing sales crisis plaguing the industry as a whole. But the arrival of new motorcycles within the Pulsar family has certainly helped in recent months.
In September 2019, Bajaj registered a total of 1,77,348 units with 35% YoY negative sales and ended up fourth in the overall manufacturers’ table when the two-wheeler industry met with a fall of 22.1%. Following the CT100 and Platina, Bajaj’s most sold motorcycle for September was the Pulsar 150, which recorded a total of 32,320 units.
It does not tell the whole picture as Pulsar 150 endured a huge sales decline of 50% as 64,900 units were retailed during the same month the previous year. It goes on to show that the Pulsar 125 has eaten into its volumes by a big margin. With 20,688 unit sales, the entry-level Pulsar is going strong and last month Bajaj announced that the motorcycle had reached 40,000 sales milestone.
