Once again, fintech giant Square has shocked the Bitcoin industry with its latest earnings report; the company’s flagship product, the Cash App, sold $148 million worth of BTC in fiscal Q3 of 2019. This marks significant retail interest in cryptocurrency from Square’s American clientele.
Crypto analyst Kevin Rooke pointed out that this is the sixth straight quarter of growth for this facet of Square’s business. Rooke also noted that Bitcoin revenues at Square are now growing by a jaw-dropping 244% year-over-year, despite the fact that BTC remains over 50% below its previous all-time high of $20,000.
