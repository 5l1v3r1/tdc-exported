NEW DELHI: Senior IAS officer Arvind Singh on Wednesday took charge as the chairman of the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
A Maharashtra cadre officer of 1988 batch, Singh was additional chief secretary (energy) in Maharashtra. He has also worked as managing director of Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Ltd and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company.
Singh joined IAS after acquiring bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics from St Stephen’s College, Delhi and from the Delhi School of Economics, respectively. Moving to the Centre in 2001, he worked in various ministries including commerce and shipping.
Singh joins AAI at a time when the state-run operator has major expansion plans to augment both airport and air navigation system infrastructure.
He succeeds Guruprasad Mohapatra who was earlier this year elevated as secretary, department of industry and internal trade, in the ministry of commerce.
