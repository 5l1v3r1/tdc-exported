Ming-Na Wen. Badass. Interchangeable descriptions, really.
Vanity Fair has just dropped a sneaky new teaser for The Mandalorian. It’s got some new footage compared to even last week’s trailer, one that, shock of shocks, actually features a lot more than just Werner Herzog Werner-Herzogging all over the show.
Actual dialogue, albeit brief! We get to hear a little more from Kuuil the Ugnaught, who’s been glimpsed in both merchandise and briefly in the trailers (and this trailer seemingly confirms that he’s indeed Nick Nolte’s previously unannounced character) as one of the many associates of Pedro Pascal’s masked Mandalorian – although here he’s telling us he’s never actually met a Mandalorian before, so they’re perhaps not quite really associates just yet.
But we also get to hear from a character we’ve not seen at all: Ming-Na Wen’s mysterious mercenary (is there anyone in this show who isn’t one of those?), Fennec Shand.
