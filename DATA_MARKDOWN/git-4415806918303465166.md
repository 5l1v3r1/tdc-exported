Tayto has deleted a social media post that paid tribute to the late Gay Byrne after a backlash online.
The tweet had read: "It's a sad day for the Nation (sic). Rest in peace Gay."
The Twitter post included a picture of the crisp firm's mascot, Mr Tayto, looking sad.
Tayto's post, coming so soon after the news of Gaybo's death, annoyed some social media users.
One tweeted: "It is with a heavy heart that I must announce Mr Tayto has been cancelled."
Another said: "I'm gonna need some time to process that Tayto tweet. Hold tight, dear reader."
Another person added: "This moronic crisp ad is how I learned of the death of a towering figure in Irish society. Pathetic."
An account named Branded Hellscape Ireland, which tweets "a selection of the very worst in Irish branded content", changed its profile picture to the sad Mr Tayto.
The owner also posted: "I'm retiring this account."
