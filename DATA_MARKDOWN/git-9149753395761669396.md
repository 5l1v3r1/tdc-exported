Tomorrow is the day Red Dead Redemption 2 rides over to PC, and if you are planning to play it, there are updated graphics drivers available from both AMD and Nvidia. We already wrote about Nvidia's latest GPU driver (444.12 WHQL), so let's talk about AMD's newest release (19.11.1).
Adding support for RDR2 is the highlight here. AMD does not offer up any specific performance claims, but if you're raring to saddle up tomorrow, the 19.11.1 release will presumably offer the best overall experience (assuming there are no ill side effects).
Beyond that, AMD added support for some additional Vulkan extensions, as outlined in the release notes, and fixed a few issues. One of them deals with a connection bug affecting Twitch, and there are also a couple of fixes related to The Outer Worlds. Here's a look:
There are also a bunch of known issues that AMD has yet to fix. They include:
In related news, Rockstar Games is getting a head start on the Black Friday deals season by offering a free upgrade to the Special Edition of RDR2—it's currently priced at $59.99 instead of $79.99. Likewise, the Ultimate Edition is on sale for $79.99, down from $99.99 right now.
