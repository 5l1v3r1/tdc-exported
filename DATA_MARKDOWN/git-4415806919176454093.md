Riot police have stormed several shopping centres in Hong Kong in a move to thwart more pro-democracy protests.
But violence did break out when a knife-wielding man slashed several people and bit off part of the ear of a local pro-democracy politician.
Tonight outside Cityplaza, a man slashed several people with a knife and bit off part of the ear of a district councillor who was trying to stop him from leaving.
Local media said the man told his victims that Hong Kong belongs to China.
Television footage showed the man biting the councillorâ€™s ear and being badly beaten up by a crowd after the attack, before police arrived. At least five people were injured, reports said.
