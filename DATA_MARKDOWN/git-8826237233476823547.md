This week, Dua Lipa introduces us to her new era and the first release off her sophomore album with the disco-dance tune “Don’t Start Now.” Ariana Grande teams up with Chaka Khan on the Charlie’s Angels soundtrack, with fun results. Labrinth shows off the spectrum of his skills in the lead-up to his new album. Maluma and his fellow Colombians Feid and Sky make a suave reggaeton slow-burner. And blink-182 pops up on a new track from Goody Grace.
