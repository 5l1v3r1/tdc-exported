(Reuters) - Golden State Warriors All-Star guard Stephen Curry will be out for at least three months after undergoing successful surgery in Los Angeles on Friday for a broken left hand, the NBA team said.
The two-time NBA most valuable player is expected to make a full recovery from the break which occurred when he was driving to the basket in Wednesdayâ€™s loss to the Phoenix Suns.
The Warriors, league champions in 2015, 2017 and 2018, have struggled this season, winning only once in four games.
