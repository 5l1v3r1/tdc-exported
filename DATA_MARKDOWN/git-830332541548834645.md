MADISON, Wis. - Several Wisconsin stadiums around the state were blanketed with snow after Wednesday's snowfall.
All across the state, from Madison to Green Bay, sports stadiums got a fresh blanket of snow. Some of Wisconsin's sports teams embraced the snow, while others shied away from it.
LambeauÂ Field got a fresh coat of snow ahead of the Packers' game against the Panthers that's set for Nov. 10.
