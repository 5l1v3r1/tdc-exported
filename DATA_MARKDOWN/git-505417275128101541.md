        Stephen Kenny has named his Irish U21 squad ahead of their upcoming European Qualifiers against Armenia and Sweden.
      
As expected, Tottenham striker Troy Parrott is not involved after Mick McCarthy confirmed that he would be in the senior squad for their games against New Zealand and Denmark.
Aaron Connolly is also not involved for the same reasons while Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher, Stoke City’s Nathan Collins and Southampton’s Michael Obafemi move back down to the 21s from McCarthy’s provisional squad.
