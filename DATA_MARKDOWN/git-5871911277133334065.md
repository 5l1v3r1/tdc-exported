The Penn Quakers defeated the Brown Bears 38-36 in a roller coaster of a football game on Saturday afternoon at Franklin Field, which ended with a game-winning field goal from sophomore kicker Daniel Karrash.
With the result, Penn picked up their first win of the season in Ivy League play.
Despite having never attempted a field goal with the Quakers, Karrash had his number called with five seconds left in the game from 22 yards out.
“I was just trying to stay composed and keep faith in my guy’s upfront,” Karrash said. “I was just trying to hit a good ball through the uprights. I didn’t try and switch anything depending on what type of kick it is.”
