JUSTICE Minister Charlie Flanagan has called for the silent vigil outside a proposed emergency accommodation centre in Achill to be stood down.
He made his request for 'the seige to be lifted' to RTÈ News in light of ongoing protests at the site of the Achill Head Hotel in Keel which had been selected as a location to provide emergency temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.
Yesterday, the Department of Justice and Equality put off plans to house 13 women in the hotel due to ongoing protests at the site.
Minister Flanagan urged demonstrators to engage in dialogue with his department to help protect "vulnerable people".
