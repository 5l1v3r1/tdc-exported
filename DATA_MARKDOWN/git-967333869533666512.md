        The 50-50 merger will create a $48 billion automaker while also saving $4 billion a year, according to the two companies. The deal will also make it the world's fourth-largest automaker, following the top three of Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan, and Toyota.
      
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Peugeot (PSA) have confirmed the deal to create a joint company, CNBC news reported on Thursday, with FCA's John Elkann becoming the chairman and PSA's Carlos Tavares becoming the CEO of the future company. 
Fiat Chrysler and PSA said that the future company should save more than $4 billion a year from "run-rate synergies without any plant closures''. It will also emerge as the fourth-largest auto company in the world, after Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan, and Toyota.
Additionally, such brands as Alfa Romeo, Citroën, Chrysler, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall, will be united under the announced tied-up.
The emerging company will be registered in the Netherlands, while also maintaining head-office locations in France, Italy, and the US.
Earlier, PSA Group wrote on its official Twitter account that the merger aims to make the company into a global leader and enter a new era of sustainable mobility.
