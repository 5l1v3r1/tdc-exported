BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that the United States should not “gesticulate” about the South China Sea issue.
Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comments at a daily news briefing in Beijing.
A U.S. envoy denounced Chinese “intimidation” in the South China Sea at a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders on Monday and invited them to a special summit in Washington on behalf of President Donald Trump.
