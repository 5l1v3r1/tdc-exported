Poppy has released a new single called ‘Bloodmoney’ along with its surreal official video – watch below.
The Los Angeles artist is set to release her third album ‘I Disagree‘ in January, and has already previewed the project with its title track and ‘Concrete’. It follows on from 2018’s ‘Am I A Girl’.
Now, Poppy has shared another glimpse at the upcoming LP with the twisted sounds of ‘Bloodmoney’. “What do you believe when everyone is watching/ What do you believe when nobody is watching,” Poppy asks at the top of the track, which contains eardrum-rupturing bass and heavy drums.
With the track carrying religious themes throughout, the accompanying video sees Poppy – dressed in an all-white – standing in front of a red neon crucifix before ascending into the air. Elsewhere, she furiously battles with a number of figures donning black boilersuits.
