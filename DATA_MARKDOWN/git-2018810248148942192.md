BlizzCon 2019 promises to be one of the most interesting gaming events amid some serious political turmoil as well as some exciting new releases.
But before all the grizzly details are announced, we want to take a quick look at what's almost certainly going to be announced and what we're speculating might be unveiled. Without further ado, here's a roundup of what to expect for BlizzCon 2019.
We can fairly confidently say we're expecting an announcement regarding Overwatch 2 for BlizzCon 2019 after some leaks from a supposed training document were released. The new information reveals there's likely a new hero on the way, a new four-player PvE mode and potentially some upgrades to Tracer's pulse bomb.
