President Cyril Ramaphosa secured around R360 billion of investment pledges from businesses on Wednesday, saying these would spur economic growth and reduce unemployment.
But analysts said some of the pledges at South Africa’s annual conference to promote new investment opportunities were just regular operating costs and questioned whether those made by state-owned firms should be included in the total.
They were also sceptical the commitments were of sufficient scale to meaningfully change a bleak economic outlook.
Ramaphosa is trying to revive Africa’s most industrialised economy after a decade of slow growth. He has promised sweeping reforms, but progress has been slow due to opposition from labour unions and parts of the ANC.
Ramaphosa said the money pledged on Wednesday was a “clear vote of confidence in South Africa and our economy”.
“After a prolonged period of stagnation, uncertainty and upheaval, I would like to believe we are firmly on the road to recovery,” he said.
