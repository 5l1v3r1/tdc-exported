        TEHRAN (Sputnik) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will send a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres regarding the so-called Hormuz peace initiative proposed by Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
      
Mousavi also recalled than Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had already sent letters to the heads of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Iraqi leadership with the initiative presented by him during the UN General Assembly.
Rouhani unveiled the initiative aimed at ensuring continued peace in the region at the 74th UNGA session in September. The plan seeks to establish security in the Strait of Hormuz and the neighboring Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the wake of high-profile security incidents there. Rouhani has said Tehran was ready to work together with the United Nations on the endeavor.
