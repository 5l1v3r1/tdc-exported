HILO, Hawaii (AP) - The latest version of proposed administrative rules for the Big Island summit where a giant telescope is planned to be built have been released.
The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports Friday that the new proposal was released along with a meeting plan.
The rules for Hawaii’s Mauna Kea have been a point of contention for some Native Hawaiians, including those opposed to the construction of the new telescope.
The University of Hawaii, which manages the land, says the rules are meant to “provide for the proper use, management and protection of cultural, natural, and scientific resources.”
Some who oppose the proposed rules say they could impede Hawaiian cultural practices and access to the summit. Protesters have been blocking telescope construction for months.
The Board of Regents will consider the proposal next week.
