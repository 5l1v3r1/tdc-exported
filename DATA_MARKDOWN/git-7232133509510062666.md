Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto markets have been caught in a firm bout of sideways trading for the past couple of weeks, with BTC trading firmly within a long-established trading range between $9,000 and $9,500.
Analysts are now noting that Bitcoin has been holding above a key technical support level, but a break below this level could lead the cryptocurrency to free fall until it finds support around the mid-$8,000 region.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down just over 1% at its current price of $9,250, which marks a notable drop from its daily highs of $9,400 that were set yesterday as bulls attempted to push the cryptocurrency to the upper boundary of its current trading range.
Because bulls have been unable to propel Bitcoin towards or above $9,500, bears may currently have the upper-hand as they begin pushing BTC back down towards the lower-$9,000 region.
It is important to note that where Bitcoin trends in the near-term will likely be primarily guided by which range boundary is decisively broken above/below first.
Mr. Anderson, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that the next price discovery phase will kick off when the crypto moves above the red lines seen on the below chart.
