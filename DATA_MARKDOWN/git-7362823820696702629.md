Fans at Saturday's Breeders' Cup will get to see a competitor bearing one of President Trump's signature lines from Twitter.
Jamie Roth, who runs a LNJ Foxwoods stable, thought Trump's apparent typo -- "covfefe" -- would be a good name for one of her horses.
“We gave the name to her because we thought she was special and we thought the name was kind of funny," she told USA Today.
"Covfefe" the horse, 3, is reportedly the morning line favorite for the Breeders' Cup and even has her own Twitter account that pokes fun at the president. Titled "RealCovfefeRacehorse," the account often plays off of Trump's statements online.
