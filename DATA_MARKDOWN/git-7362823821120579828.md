Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke’s magic dust was not so magic, Media Buzz host Howie Kurtz told “The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.”
“The pundits essentially drafted this failed Senate candidate into the race. His campaign was always kind of a media creation, and Beto O’Rourke never came close to living up to all the hype,” Kurtz said.
O’Rourke announced last week that he is withdrawing from the 2020 presidential race, telling supporters: “it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.”
