The Hidden Nazi examines the role of General Hans Kammler, described in the book’s synopsis as “the worst Nazi war criminal you’ve never heard of.” A project supervisor of the Nazis’ rocket weapons program, Kammler’s technological expertise was sought after by both the U.S. and Soviet Union towards the end of World War II.
Kammler’s knowledge of Nazi-developed rocket technology was critical to American victory in the Cold War, stated Reuter.
“Very clearly, we ended up benefiting [from Hans Kammler’s knowledge],” Reuter said. “Everybody could have used that knowledge, and, if you think back to World War II … it was known pretty far in advance that the Germans were going to lose the war, and there was going to be this mad scramble for this technology — not just the rocket technology, but all sorts of other technology — and for gold, and for treasure.”
