        Hot girl summer hasn't finished yet! Megan Thee Stallion still has more in store for us hotties.
      
A real hot girl would not hang up her hot girl hat just because summer’s over. One of rap’s newest queens, Megan Thee Stallion, knows this all too well, bringing us horror-inspired webisodes this Halloween season. Full of subtle jokes with freaky Buffy the Vampire Slayer realness, this web series is one to tune into. Real hotties know that we run the world all year round, and Hottieween proves this perfectly.
The entertaining pilot “Love Hurts” introduces Houston’s hottest stallion to the small screen. If you could get past her slightly stiff acting (like come on! It’s her first gig), Megan’s witty bad-assery combined with her cadence makes the first two episodes a delight to watch. She has conceptualised a modern take on horror for all hot girls to enjoy, cuddled up in their snuggly blankets.
