WAUSAU, Wis. - A man is facing homicide charges in a fatal crash in Wausau that investigators say was caused by huffing.
Bond has been set at $100,000 cash for 36-year-old Enrique Sanchez. He's charged with homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle, homicide by used of a controlled substance and first-degree recklessly endangering safety.
Thirty-one-year-old Danielle Dahlquist was a passenger in Sanchez's vehicle when he crashed into a light pole and a second vehicle in a Rib Mountain parking lot last August.
WSAW-TV reports prosecutors say a chemical from an electronic duster spray was found in Sanchez's blood. Investigators say evidence of cocaine and fentanyl was also in his system.
Court records do not list a defense attorney.
