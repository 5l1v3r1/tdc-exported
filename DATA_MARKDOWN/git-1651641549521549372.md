Today on twitter Elon Musk announced the launch date of the Tesla Cybertruck.
Musk has given a lot of hints about the all-important design of the long-awaited light truck, such that it will look like an “armoured personnel carrier from the future”.
He has also said it will feature a 400-500 mile range, dual-motor all-wheel-drive drive train and dynamic suspension, and “300,000 lbs of towing capacity.”
Today he revealed the launch date of the Tesla Cybertruck will be on the 21st November in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory.
