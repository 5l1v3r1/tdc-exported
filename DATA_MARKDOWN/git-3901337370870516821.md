With Juventus looking to bolster their squad, Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah was one of four players who were reportedly scouted by the Bianconeri during the Reds' recent Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur.

On Tuesday, reports emerged from Italy that representatives from Juve were present at Liverpool's match against Spurs last weekend to scout no fewer than four players, including two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner Salah. 
According to Tuttosport, the reigning Serie A champions sent scouts to watch the Egyptian superstar as well as the Spurs trio of Heung-min Son, Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen, the latter pair of which are reportedly unsettled in north London.

The Bianconeri will have been impressed by Salah's performance, with the 27-year-old scoring the match-winning goal in the Reds' 2-1 victory before being substituted, but will undoubtedly face a challenge in convincing Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to let go of one of his key men. 
That is similarly the case with Tottenham's Son, although Eriksen and Alderweireld could be viable targets given their current respective contractual situations with last season's beaten UEFA Champions League finalists.

Spurs could face a massive overhaul in the summer should they lose the star trio, with soon-to-be out-of-contract defender Jan Vertonghen also linked with a move to Inter Milan.
