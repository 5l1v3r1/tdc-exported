ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi underwent successful hernia surgery on Tuesday.
Currently incarcerated in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) scandal, Abbasi was shifted from Adiala jail to a hospital after his health deteriorated on November 4.
However, the surgery was delayed after the former prime minister’s blood pressure increased.
Abbasi is expected to stay in the hospital for a week.
The medical board, which recommended the hernia surgery, also said that Abbasi had stones in his bladder and kidney.
Earlier, the former premier moved a petition in the accountability court seeking permission to be treated at Al-Shifa Hospital.
“I want to undergo surgery at Al-Shifa Hospital at my expense. The Punjab government is not ready to take any responsibility,” he added.
