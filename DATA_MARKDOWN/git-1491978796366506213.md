        80-year-old driver collided with HGV on motorway while taking part in Veteran Car Run
      
A man has died during a vintage car rally after his vehicle, which was more than 100 years old, collided with a lorry on the motorway in Sussex.
The 80-year-old and his female passenger, believed to be a married couple, were taking part in Bonham’s London to Brighton Veteran Car Run on Sunday when they took a wrong turn, deviating from the rally’s official route before winding up on the motorway.
Their 1903 Knox Runabout Old Porcupine – a tiny, open-cabin vehicle with a single-cylinder engine and max speed of 35mph – collided with an HGV near Junction 7 on the southbound M23, outside Hooley, Surrey.
Emergency services arrived shortly after 10am. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman suffered serious head injuries and was airlifted to hospital.
Surrey police confirmed the man’s death in a statement, adding that the next of kin had been notified and asking anyone who witnessed the collision to come forward.
