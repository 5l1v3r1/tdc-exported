Dua Lipa has described social media as a “breeding ground for hate” and admitted that she often searches for negative comments on her “vulnerable” days.
The ‘Don’t Start Now’ singer is an avid user of Instagram and constantly uses the site to provide updates for fans as the release of her second album grows ever closer.
However, she admits that the platform is often used by trolls to spread negative comments that have previously affected her .
“Some days I don’t read into the comments, some days maybe I feel a little bit more vulnerable and I dive in and I almost go looking for things that I don’t want to see,” she admitted.
