REUTERS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday classified the recall of Abbott Laboratories' CentriMag blood pumping system, following the death of a patient, as Class 1 or the most serious type of recall.
Forty-four injuries and one death were reported at the time when Abbott started the recall in August this year, the FDA said. (http://bit.ly/2NDsz57)
