J. Cole has teased that he will be releasing a new album titled ‘The Fall Off’ some time next year.
Sharing the news during his headline performance at the Day N Vegas festival in Las Vegas last night (November 1), it will be Cole’ sixth studio album and follows 2018’s ‘KOD’.
Topping a bill that also featured Miguel, Lil Uzi Vert, Juice WRLD and 6LACK, Cole brought out Dreamville signees Bas, J.I.D., EarthGang and Cozz, which enabled him to debut songs from his ‘Revenge of the Dreamers III’ compilation live for the first time.
During the show, a parody campaign video popped up on the screen. Featuring the message: “Fuck them taxes,” the video ended by saying, “Make your voice heard. Vote for The Fall Off 2020.”
The crowd were also given posters to wave bearing ‘The Fall Off 2020’ graphics.
