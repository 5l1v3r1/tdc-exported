The ordering process for Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-views has changed: UFC 244 is only available on ESPN+ in the U.S.Kelvin Gastelum will attempt to avoid the first two-fight losing streak of his career when he confronts Darren Till in the UFC 244 co-main event on Saturday at Madison Square Garden in New York. Gastelum last competed in April, when he lost a five-round unanimous decision to Israel Adesanya in a battle over the interim Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight crown. A rematch with the now-undisputed champion could be in the offing if he manages to make a statement against Till.Gastelumâ€™s exploits are under the microscope in this edition of The Film Room.
