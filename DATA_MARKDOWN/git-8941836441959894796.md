AT&T; will pay $60 million to settle the government’s allegation that it misled customers of unlimited-data plans by slowing down service for heavy users.
The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday that AT&T; will automatically provide partial refunds to customers who signed up for unlimited wireless plans before 2011.
The FTC sued AT&T; in 2014 for not clearly letting customers know that if they used up a certain amount of data, AT&T; would slow their speeds so much that web browsing was almost impossible. It said then that AT&T; had throttled at least 3.5 million customers.
The agency says AT&T; is required to say prominently if data speeds or amounts are restricted.
Today, AT&T;’s website says it may slow speeds of unlimited plans after a certain amount of data is used.
