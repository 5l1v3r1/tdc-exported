Speaking to Breitbart London’s James Delingpole, Mr Bridgen tried to reconcile the two economic positions being debated in the Tory Party: one that upholds the values of lower taxation versus the kind of big, public spending favoured by ‘One Nation Conservatives’.
“You can’t out-Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservatives should never try and outspend the Labour Party. I’m always very wary of this. Democracy relies on solvency,” the MP for North West Leicestershire said.
He continued: “The most depressing thing on the doorstep is when I see someone… and I give them the leaflet, and they say, ‘I’m going to decide after I see what the other side is offering me.’
“If we were all to vote for the party which gave us the most things, the most money, the country will go bankrupt. We can’t outspend or out-promise the Marxists in the Labour Party. They’re just going to use the double cube. Whatever we offer to spend on the NHS, they’ll just say they’ll spend more… there lies the road to bankruptcy.”
