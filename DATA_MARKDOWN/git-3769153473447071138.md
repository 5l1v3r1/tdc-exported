Paint PBR texture maps via a Substance Painter-like workflow with this slick new tool.
Last week, we covered Material Maker, a promising procedural texture-generation tool that many artists hope will become a viable alternative to Adobe's Substance Designer. But is there an open-source alternative to its sister application, Substance Painter?
One possibility suggested in the comments section of the original story is ArmorPaint: a new 3D painting package being developed by the team behind the Armory game engine. It offers a familiar base workflow, an interesting range of more advanced features, and is free to compile from source.
The software has been in development since last year, but since the team has just released the first developer builds for ArmorPaint 0.7, now seems a good time to check it out.
