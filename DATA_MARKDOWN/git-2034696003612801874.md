A list of things that Mallrat – aka Aussie singer and producer Grace Shaw – has done in 2019: in February, she did swapped Australia for another sunny base, Los Angeles, California. She then spent much of the early part of 2019 on the road with Maggie Rogers, hit up festivals around the world performances, turned 21, been nominated for an MTV EMA, and released her best EP so far in ‘Driving Music’. Oh, and she made her first appearance on a major US TV show and looked completely at home while doing so.
The night before Shaw answers her phone from a buzzing LA coffee shop, she was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with James Corden, for a gorgeous performance of ‘Charlie’ – one of ‘Driving Music’’s highlights. It was simple but effective, its slow build delivering big returns on emotion and gently giddy atmospherics, all while the musician had the confidence to keep her movements small and steady and not over-perform. “It was kind of crazy,” she laughs down the line nearly 24 hours later. “It was such a cool experience. It was really nice that was my first [big TV experience] cos everyone was so lovely there.”
