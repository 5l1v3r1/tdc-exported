YOKOHAMA: England tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler has been knocked out cold while attempting a tackle in the third minute of the Rugby World Cup final against South Africa in Yokohama on Saturday.
The 26-year-old Sinckler attempted to tackle South Africa winger Makazole Mapimpi, but made contact with team mate Maro Itoje's shoulder and fell to the ground, with referee Jerome Garces immediately calling a halt to play.
After medical treatment he managed to walk off the field. Dan Cole has replaced him, with the score 0-0 after Handre Pollard missed an early penalty.
