Named respondents in an administrative case filed by former municipal Engineer Crispin G. Laureano before the anti-graft body were municipal Mayor Sylvia C. Austria, her son, Councilor Sylvestre C. Austria, municipal Treasurer Edelson Espiritu and contractor Ma. Perla Tablante, of the Pearl Cast Construction and Trading.
In his complaint, Laureano claimed that the LGU of Jaen made full payment for three alleged ghost projects worth P4.5-million whose construction did not even start prior to the period that was indicated in their respective disbursement vouchers dated July 13, 2018.
These three projects allegedly involved a P1.5-million streetlights project in various barangays of the town, a P2-million multi-purpose building in Bgy. G.E. Antonino and the construction/reblocking of the access road in Bgy. Sapang worth P1million.
