The Cool Kids and Kenny Beats collaborating on a song makes total sense but for some reason, it seems completely unexpected. Chuck Inglish and Sir Michael Rocks link up with Kenny on the new single, "Dipped" which is undoubtedly a bop. Over some trippy trap music with evident influence from Chuck Inglish, Kenny Beats provides a muddy backdrop for Chuck Inglish and Sir Michael Rocks to vibe out to.
“I remember hearing the Cool Kids for the first time; deleted all my beats and threw out all my clothes,” Kenny Beats said about his new collab with The Cool Kids “Bought a NCAA SnapBack and started pitching all my samples as low as I could. To call them friends and collaborators now in unreal to me.”
Quotable LyricsYou can ask Chuck Norris, I don't know what the score isBut I know we beat your ass, and she was pressin' me to smashTold you mama, I'mma pass, around the back through the legsTouch down do my dance, primetime Deion Sanders
