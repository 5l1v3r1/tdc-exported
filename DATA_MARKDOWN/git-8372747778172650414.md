PUNTA GORDA, Fla. — The Punta Gorda Police Department is warning the public about an employment scam going around.
The Secret Shopper employment scam involves the scammer hiring an unsuspected person to be a secret shopper.
The scammer will send the victim a check and advise them to cash the check at their bank and make a purchase of gift cards at a store during their evaluation.
The scammer will then use all of the funds on the gifts cards, and the victim will discover that the check was fraudulent, leaving the victim out all of the money.
Deputies want to remind you legitimate opportunities don’t involve someone asking you to pick up gift cards.
If you find yourself a victim of this scam, call the Sheriff's Office.
