        Financial regulators in Hong Kong will introduce clear cut rules to govern the operations of cryptocurrency exchanges. Meanwhile, reports show that fund managers continue to struggle with the stringent requirements for crypto investment in Hong Kong.
      
According to Reuters, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is ready to introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges in the city. Speaking at a fintech conference on Wednesday (November 6, 2019) in Hong Kong, Ashley Alder, head of the SFC remarked:
Back in 2018, Bitcoinist reported that cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong were coming under increased regulatory scrutiny. At the time, the SFC revealed that it was developing a new approach to overseeing the activities of local crypto exchange platforms.
According to Alder, the new regulatory framework will focus on know your customer (KYC) and custody requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. Such a move could pave the way for the emergence of formally legalized cryptocurrency exchange listings in the city.
Tweeting on Wednesday, Primitive Ventures co-founder and Chinese crypto insider, Dovey Wan remarked that the incoming regulations could see the likes of Huobi becoming the first “legalized Chinese cryptocurrency exchange.”
