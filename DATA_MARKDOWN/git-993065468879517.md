JacobÂ Rees-Mogg has "profoundly" apologised for suggesting Grenfell victims should have used "common sense" and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block.
His apology came after an LBC appearance on Monday, during which the Commons leader had discussed London Fire Brigade's (LFB) 'stay-put' policy and said: "If you just ignore what you're told and leave you are so much safer.
"I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building.
"It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didn't happen."
