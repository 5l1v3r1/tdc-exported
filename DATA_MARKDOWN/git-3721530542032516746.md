Death Stranding is still a few days away from release, but that didn’t stop Hideo Kojima, the game’s director, from hinting at what he could do next. As part of a BBC documentary on the making of the game, the legendary game designer said that his studio, Kojima Productions, will start making films in the future.
“If you can do one thing well, you can do everything well,” Kojima jokes in the documentary.
