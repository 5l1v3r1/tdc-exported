Two Malian soldiers were killed and six more injured as a result of a blast of an improvised explosive device in the central part of the country, the national Armed Forces said on Sunday in a statement.
The injured were evacuated with a military helicopter to a hospital in the town of Sevare.
A large-scale "terrorist attack" on a military post in Mali on Friday has claimed the lives of 49 soldiers and one civilian with Daesh* claiming responsibility for the attack.
Next day, the Elysee Palace said that a French soldier was killed as an explosive device detonated near his armoured vehicle.
The situation in Mali was destabilized in 2012 when the Tuareg militants seized vast territories in the northern part of the country. The conflict escalated even more over the activities of Islamists, forces loyal to former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as well as French interference.
The tensions have significantly de-escalated since then, however sporadic clashes are taking place so far.
