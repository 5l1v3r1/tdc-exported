The ''permitless carry'' gun law came into effect in Oklahoma on Friday, media reported. The law allows Oklahomans over 21 to open or conceal carry a gun without a license or special training, except for those convicted of certain crimes and non-residents.
Oklahoma's authorities, however, warned that firearms are still restricted at public buildings, including bars, schools, sporting events and also on college campuses.
