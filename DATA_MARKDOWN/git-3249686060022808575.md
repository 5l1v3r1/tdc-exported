Netizens smugly commented, after reading the old but heartwarming post, "It was a happy ending kekekeke", "Aigoo Jonghyun kekekeke", "Wow A9, I'm jealous!", "The husband sounds real excited kekekeke", "It's your chance! Kekekeke", "This is too much of a happy ending kekekeke", "Wow he even photoshops them for her", "I guess they were meant to be hehehe", and more!
