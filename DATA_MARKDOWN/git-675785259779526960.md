We know how amazingly hard our NHS staff work but the strain they face due to Tory cuts is immense.
We lack the nurses to properly care for patients while Tory NHS pension changes are driving out doctors or forcing them to cut their shifts.
Budgets for repairs have been slashed and social care support savaged, causing yet more misery for patients.
Today official statistics show waiting lists are at record levels, the numbers waiting longer than 18 weeks for treatment are over 660,000.
 
Shamefully cancer patients are cruelly failed.
When you need treatment, you need it as soon as possible.
In the past year over 32,000 patients waited beyond two months.
Staff are warning about the coming winter.
Last winter over 215,000 patents were stranded on trolleys, doctors are warning this winter it will be 300,000.
This is what happens when the Tories cut over 15,000 beds.
Ensuring cancer patients are given lifesaving treatment needed will be a Labour priority.
We’ll fund our NHS properly and recruit more staff.
