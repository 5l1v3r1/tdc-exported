The reaction to some of the England team refusing to wear their silver medals after the Rugby World Cup final has been staggering over the past few days.
After falling to South Africa 32-12 in Yokohama on Saturday, the England team have seemingly been called all the names under the sun for not wearing their medals around their neck.
While the team have been defended by some, Eddie Jonesâ€™ side have largely been treated with disdain.But footage has been shared on Twitter by Phil Llewellyn of past runners-up having the exact same reaction as the England team.
In 2003, locks Justin Harrison and Matt Cobain, as well as Stirling Mortlock did not put their medals on, while others took theirs off as they walked away. In 2015, David Pocock is seen not wearing his medal either, but managed to avoid the scorn the English players have received.
