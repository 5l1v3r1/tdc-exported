        Former Acting CIA Director John McLaughlin said on Wednesday that he was grateful for the "deep state's" role in prompting the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, noting that his colleagues are continuing to “do their work irrespective of what [Trump’s] going to do or say.”
      
CBS reporter Margaret Brennan pointed out in her interview with McLaughlin that the origin of the impeachment inquiry likely furthered Trump's concerns about the "deep state."
McLaughlin spoke out at an event hosted by George Mason University, joined by former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former CIA Director John Brennan - both known critics of President Trump.
“With all of the people who knew what was going on here, it took an intelligence officer to step forward and say something about it, which was the trigger that then unleashed everything else,” McLaughlin said, referring to the whistleblower complaint about President Trump's July call with Ukraine.
