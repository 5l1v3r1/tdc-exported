Pokemon Sword and Shield spoilers have hit the internet thanks to data miners and leakers aplenty. Details that are now public include the entire Galar Pokedex (the list of all Pokemon in the games’ new Galar region), starter Pokemon evolutions, new Gigantamax forms, and a complete list of all 8th generation Pokemon.
The Galar Pokedex has 400 Pokemon excluding Mythical variants. Furthermore there are 81 new species and 13 Galarian forms. Dedicated Pokemon spoiler account CentroLeaks tweeted the full Galar Pokedex as well as other crucial bits of information.
