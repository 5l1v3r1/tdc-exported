Liverpool head to Villa Park aiming to maintain their six-point cushion over Manchester City before the two sides meet at Anfield next Sunday. Liverpool’s last visit here ended in a 6-0 away win, but Jürgen Klopp cannot expect such a one-sided contest on Saturday afternoon; only Bournemouth have won at Villa Park so far. Naby Keïta faces a fitness test and Joël Matip is unavailable for the visitors, while Jack Grealish is likely to be in contention for Aston Villa after overcoming a knock. Niall McVeigh
