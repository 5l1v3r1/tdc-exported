Silicon Valley is helping the global slave trade thrive — and critics argue it should be held accountable for facilitating the barbarous practice.
Posing as a husband and wife, a team from BBC News Arabic found it was disturbingly easy to discover human traffickers selling slaves online on Instagram and other popular apps.
“In the Gulf, women employed as domestic workers are being sold online via apps approved and provided by Google and Apple,” the investigators say in a video they released on Thursday. “It’s been called an online slave market.”
The investigators contacted and met with several of the people advertising domestic workers for sale online, including one in Kuwait who offered to sell them “Fatou” — a 16-year-old girl from Guinea, West Africa — for US$3,800.
“This is the quintessential example of modern slavery,” Urmila Bhoola, UN Special Rapporteur, Contemporary Forms of Slavery, told BBC News Arabic. “Here we see a child being sold and traded like chattel, like a piece of property.”
