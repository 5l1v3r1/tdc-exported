A group called No Blackface Vancouver is pushing operators of a Surrey theatre to cancel a touring show they say is racist.
Im Hussein: Double Trouble is scheduled to be performed at Surrey’s Bell Performing Arts Centre on Saturday, Nov. 2.
On Friday (Nov. 1), the Now-Leader received an emailed press release from No Blackface Vancouver.
“It has come to this group’s attention that the Bell Performing Arts Centre will host a play titled “Im Hussein Double Trouble” on Nov 2nd, 2019 at 8pm,” the release says. “We are organizing to request that Metro Vancouver communities move quickly to ensure that this play is not staged due to its clearly advertised use of: blackface; the perpetuation of racist, anti-Black, anti-African (anti-Nigerian) and Orientalist narratives and tropes; and the inappropriate use of stereotypically exaggerated African and Chinese costume.”
