“Tonight, worship was lifted, the name of Christ was exalted, the Word of God was preached, a multitude prayed together, the Gospel was clearly proclaimed, and an opportunity to respond was given,” Pastor Brewington explained in an Instagram post. “In a crowd of 6,000, people from all walks of life, all ages, and all races, I witnessed over 1,000 people respond to The Gospel by raising their hands to accept Jesus as their Lord & Savior!”
A livestream of the moving service was posted online and shows West, flanked by a choir, perform a set of spiritual hymns and a slew of songs from his new album Jesus Is King.
