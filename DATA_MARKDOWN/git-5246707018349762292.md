Next year in May, Bandai Namco's mascot Pac-Man turns 40. At this point, he's pretty much done it all. Heck, he's even become a regular fighter in the Super Smash Bros. roster.
To celebrate the upcoming occasion, Bamco has launched an official PAC-MAN 40th Anniversary theme song as part of its new campaign "Join the PAC". It was composed by the famed Japanese techno producer, DJ. Ken Ishii. There's also a music video to go with it.
