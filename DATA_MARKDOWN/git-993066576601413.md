GARDA representatives have called for more officers to be deployed in border areas following the recent attacks and threats.
Concerns have been raised following renewed threats the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings, as well as incidents such as Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny's car being burnt out and a fire at Emyvale Garda Station.
Antoinette Cunningham, from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, said her colleagues in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are "extremely concerned" about policing along the border.
James Morrisroe of the Garda Representative Association called for more "gardaí on the beat", telling RTÉ: "We need to get frontline, uniformed gardaí back into the communities."
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the government had increased garda resources along the border and would do so again.
He said recent "lawlessness" in the region was being treated with the "utmost seriousness".
Garda Commissioner Drew Harris is due to meet the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings next week.
