One would ideally choose a hatchback for driving in the city and an SUV for venturing out on the highways. Further, if one wants to move around with more occupants, it has to be an MPV. These are the cliched choices of vehicles depending on where you want to head and its purpose. The Renault Triber, however, does not fit in any of these set definitions but blends in the qualities of all of them together, claims the company. We take the youngest Renault to beautiful North India and visit the last official Indian village, get mesmerised by stars and also capture some of the most picturesque landscapes that the country has to offer.
