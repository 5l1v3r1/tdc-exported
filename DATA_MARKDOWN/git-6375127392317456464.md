Moreno left Manila around 1 a.m. yesterday (Sunday) via the NAIA Terminal 2 aboard Philippine Airlines Flight PR-466 and is also scheduled to speak before international leaders at a luncheon meeting hosted by Ban.
Moreno has drawn attention from huge international leaders due, among others, to his consistent stand for a clean and green environment.
He has laid out plans to have Manila’s 46 parks and all other institutional buildings to be part of a greening project which is a major part of rehabilitation efforts already launched by the city government.
Moreno has repeatedly stated that ‘for the City of Manila to be healthy as a city or green city, we have to plant 1,600 hectares of green space.’
Aside from the already existing Arroceros Forest Park, Mehan Garden and the Sunken Garden, Moreno said he plans to create more green spaces that will include vertical ones due to lack of sufficient areas for the purpose.
While his predecessor reportedly sought to cut off trees from a portion of the 2.2-hectare Arroceros Forest Park for the purpose of building a gym, Moreno said he rejected the idea and will instead expand the said park, it being Manila’s last remaining forested area.
