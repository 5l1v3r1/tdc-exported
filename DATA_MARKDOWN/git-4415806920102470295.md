Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane admitted an opportunity had been missed to move clear at the top of LaLiga – but remained positive after a frustrating goalless draw against Real Betis at the Bernabeu.
Barcelona’s surprise defeat at Levante earlier on Saturday had given Los Blancos the chance to leapfrog their rivals.
However, after Eden Hazard’s early effort had been ruled out for offside, the home side were unable to make the most of their superior possession as Betis battled to a hard-earned point.
