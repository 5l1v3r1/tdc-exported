A Halloween party which took place in an office building used by White House staff and included families of executive-branch employees and VIP guests had all the attributes of a kid-friendly event: candy and paper airplanes, interactive displays and … a station where children were supposedly encouraged to help “Build the Wall” with their own personalised bricks.
Photos of the children’s mural with the paper wall were made public by Yahoo News.
