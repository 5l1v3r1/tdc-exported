Rapper Meek Mill joins a host of celebrities and others fighting to save the life of a Black man facing execution this month in a murder even the victim’s family reportedly believes he is innocent of.
Rodney Reed, 51, is set to be executed Nov. 20 in the strangulation death of Stacey Stites, a white woman, April 23, 1996, in Bastrop County, Texas, according to the Innocence Project.
“16 days left and he will be executed for a crime he didn’t commit .. get more info here! #freerodneyreed,” the rapper said in a tweet Monday and linked to a petition site for Reed. Other celebrities like Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, T.I., and even the European Union have taken to social media to direct their concerns to Texas Governor Gregg Abbott and push the petition.
