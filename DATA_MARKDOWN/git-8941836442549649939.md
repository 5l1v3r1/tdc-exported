MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) - Historic baseball memorabilia displayed in Ohio will soon be available to the public for auction in Kentucky.
The Cincinnati Enquirer reports items from a collection displayed for years at the former Green Diamond Gallery in the Cincinnati suburb of Montgomery will be available during a live public auction Saturday at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory in downtown Louisville.
The collection includes over 100 Hall of Fame member jerseys, hundreds of game-used bats and thousands of autographed items.
The public will be able to preview items such as Babe Ruth’s professional model baseball bat on Thursday and Friday prior to the auction scheduled to start at 10 a.m. Saturday.
The collection also will include several Cincinnati Reds items including 1940, 1975 and 1976 World Series rings.
