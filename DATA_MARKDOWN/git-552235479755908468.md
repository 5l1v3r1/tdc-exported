A Scots chippy has been named as one of the top 20 fish and chip shops in the UK.
The National Fish & Chip Awards , organised by Seafish and which celebrates one of the nation's favourite dishes, will be held on January 23, 2020.
Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven won 2nd place on the prestigious list while Lowâ€™s Traditional Fish & Chips in Aberdeen netted 11th place.
Each shop is carefully assessed by judges on a variety of elements including: sustainable sourcing policies, menu development and innovation and staff training policies.
The quality of fish and chips on offer and the levels of customer service provided will also be put under the microscope.
