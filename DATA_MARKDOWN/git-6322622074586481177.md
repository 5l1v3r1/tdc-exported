BEIJING (Nov 1): China's Foreign Ministry said on Friday China and the United States have maintained close contact on bilateral trade issues.
Trump said on Thursday that the two countries would soon announce a new location at which he and Xi would sign a "Phase One" trade deal.
But speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed as speculation talk the two leaders will meet in Macau.
