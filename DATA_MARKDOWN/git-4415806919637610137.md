Kyle Walker has tried to play down the significance of Manchester City’s battle with Liverpool as the two sides prepare to meet next week.
City manager Pep Guardiola has already fanned the flames prior to Sunday’s clash of the Premier League’s top two at Anfield by accusing Reds players of diving.
Guardiola made the comment after Sadio Mane scored a late winner against Aston Villa on Saturday to ensure Liverpool remained six points ahead of the champions at the top of the table.
Mane had been booked for diving earlier in the game, which Liverpool won 2-1.
“Sometimes he’s diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute,” Guardiola told the BBC.

Walker, who scored his own late winner as City came from behind to beat Southampton by the same scoreline at the Etihad Stadium, was less inflammatory.
“We were concentrating on our game,” said the City right-back, whose appearances in recent weeks have been restricted by illness.
