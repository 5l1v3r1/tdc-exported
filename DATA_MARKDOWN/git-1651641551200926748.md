OnePlus has started rolling out OxygenOS 10.0.5 to OnePlus 7T smartphones. The update brings bug fixes, improvement in system stability and Android security patch 2019.10.
Further, the latest OxygenOS update brings fixes for the double-tap gesture issue, meaning that the double-tap gesture will now work more reliably once you install the update on your OnePlus 7T smartphone. You can see the official changelog below.
This update will be rolled out in a phased manner, meaning that if you’re one of the few who are using the smartphone right now, you might not get it today. OnePlus, however, confirmed that it’ll begin a broader rollout in a few days.
As you can see, the OxygenOS 10.0.5 update is not as feature-rich as its predecessor OxygenOS 10.0.4, which introduced some useful new features such as cloud service in the Gallery app, improvement in camera quality, optimized translation accuracy.
Note, the update is available only for OnePlus 7T users, so if you’re using OnePlus 7T Pro or other older model you’ll have to wait a while to get it on your smartphone.
