Yesterday came the news — which went from seeming uncertain to seeming official — that Rage Against the Machine would be reuniting and playing Coachella 2020. That would presumably mean that RATM offshoot Prophets of Rage (every member of RATM except Zack de la Rocha, with vocals handled by Cypress Hill’s B-Real and Public Enemy’s Chuck D) would be calling it a day, and now both B-Real and Chuck D have issued statements on the supergroup’s demise.
