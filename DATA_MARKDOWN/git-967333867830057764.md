        If you are fed up with traffic on the road, then you should employ a doggo-driver like the guys from the video did. The good boy is so skilled in riding a motorcycle, that you are sure to be in safe hands...or paws.
      
A motorcycle ride can be twice as joyful if the rider has paws and a tail. Look how confident this little pooch is riding on the highway. His hoomans also don't have any doubts about his skills and can relax on the pillion seat. The sun is shining, the guys are chilling, the doggo is riding - the harmony is everywhere.
