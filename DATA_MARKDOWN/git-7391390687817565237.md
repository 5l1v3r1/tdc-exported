The first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK is continuing to take the nation by storm, and there's no sign of that stopping anytime soon. Baga Chipz and The Vivienne have officially stolen my heart, and the guest judge appearances just keep getting better and better with every episode. I can't even bear thinking about the finale because I don't want the show ever to end. So will RuPaul's Drag Race UK return for series two?
Well, the series won't have to sashay away anytime soon, because the BBC has confirmed that Drag Race UK will be returning for a second series. "I want to thank the BBC and all our fans for their overwhelming support of RuPaul's Drag Race UK," RuPaul told the BBC in a press statement. "This season's queens proved that Britain's Got Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent and I want to see more! Here's to another season of love, laughter and light!"
In the statement, the BBC also revealed that just halfway through the series, it's already garnered "6.5 million total requests on BBC iPlayer". Talk about iconic.
