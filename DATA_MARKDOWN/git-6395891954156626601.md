SHERMAN, Texas -
Play hard, pray hard.
A Texas high school football player made some key plays Friday night, but his actions after the game drew much more attention.
Gage Smith, a senior at Sherman High School, walked across the field after the game to pray with West Mesquite player Ty Jordan, whose mother is battling cancer, KXII reported.
"When you're playing the game, you're playing to win and the other team is the enemy, but afterwardÂ you still have respect for the other opponent," Smith told the television station.
