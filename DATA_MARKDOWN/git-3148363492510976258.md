Mark Hamill suggested that President Donald Trump had been teaching children “racism and hatred” at a Halloween party on October 25, as it featured a “Build The Wall” game promoting the security of the southern border of the United States.
The game — which allowed costumed children of executive branch staffers and other VIPs to help “Build the Wall” by writing their names on paper bricks and taping them to a wall — was put together by staff at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), where the Halloween party was held.
The EEOB offices had been instructed to put together interactive and inspiring games for child attendees, which all addressed the party’s theme: “When I grow up I want to be…”
When the Star Wars star caught wind of the child’s game, the actor took to Twitter to express his fear and disquietude over the lighthearted activity.
