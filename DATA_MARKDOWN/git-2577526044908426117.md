The weekend is for baking a cake. I think I could stand to eat a whole cake.
I haven’t got very far in The Outer Worlds, so I’d like to spend more time with that. I’ve also been playing a lot of Lonely Mountains, which is so fun, even though I spend most of my time crashing.
What about you? What are you playing?
