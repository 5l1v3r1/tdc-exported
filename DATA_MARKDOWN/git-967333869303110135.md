According to Marina Bokyo, a customs spokesperson in eastern Siberia, the woman seemed “nervous and suspicious” as she “unnaturally placed one foot in front of the other,” BBC reported. An investigation by customs officials revealed that the woman had taped eight gold discs to the soles of her feet, which set off a metal detector when she walked through it.
A criminal case was opened against the woman, who is believed to have been smuggling the gold for a Chinese citizen in exchange for cash. The woman now faces up to seven years in prison.
Another Russian national was caught at Zabaikalsk in August attempting to smuggle about 10 golden bars across the border under her sneaker insoles.
