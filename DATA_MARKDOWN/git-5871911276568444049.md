        The November 5 edition of Impact Wrestling marked the company’s second show on AXS TV. This time, the focus was on the new champion and Impact’s upcoming Turning Point event, set for Saturday, November 9.
      
The program kicked off with newly crowned Impact Wrestling World champion Sami Callihan. The champ and his oVe cohorts were in the parking lot drinking, when Sami took a shot at Chris Jericho’s “bit of the bubbly” catchphrase.
