        The 69-year-old, whose prison memoir I Will Never See the World Again was longlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize, has been released after retrial
      
The jailed Turkish author Ahmet Altan, whose detention was condemned by 38 Nobel laureates, has been released from prison after more than three years behind bars.
The 69-year-old was arrested in 2016 with his brother, the economist and journalist Mehmet Altan, on allegations of spreading “subliminal messages announcing a military coup” on television. Alongside journalist Nazlı Ilıcak, the Altan brothers were charged with attempting to overthrow constitutional order, interfering with the work of the national assembly and the government.
All three received life sentences in 2018, though Mehmet was released after four months, pending his appeal.
Altan and Ilıcak were subsequently retried on terrorism charges, and convicted. However, the court ruled on Monday to immediately release the two writers based on the time they had already served. Mehmet was acquitted due to lack of evidence.
Philippe Sands, president of English PEN and the first foreigner allowed to visit the Altan brothers during their time in prison, tweeted an image of Altan leaving prison.
