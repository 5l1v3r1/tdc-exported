Bitcoin’s meteoric rise not only made the crypto asset a household name and caused extreme FOMO at the tail end of 2017, it also caused a surge in interest in altcoins from those seeking to find the next Bitcoin.
While a “next Bitcoin” may not exist, many altcoins very well could outshine the first-ever cryptocurrency, and an expert altcoin trader and published author on the subject has shared his list of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that have a strong chance of outperforming Bitcoin in 2020.
Nik Patel is the author of a top-selling cryptocurrency book titled An Altcoin Trader’s Handbook, and runs an ongoing blog of the same name that provides regular cryptocurrency market updates, with the majority of them focused on more obscure altcoins the analyst expects to grow in value and dominance.

Patel is an expert in the space, having first got into cryptocurrencies in 2013 after stumbling upon the meme-filled Dogecoin subreddit. After he became enamored with the digital asset class, Patel tried his hand at trading altcoins and found much success, earning him a reputation as an authority in the space.
Even today, Patel shares regular updates on altcoins he sees with potential and shares it with the greater crypto community. In his latest report “Coin Trader Nik” highlights the top 5 cryptocurrencies he expects to outperform Bitcoin in the next year.
