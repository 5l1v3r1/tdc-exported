“Yes, mapapaisip ka and you’d ask ‘Ano raw?’” she laughs. “Pero ganyan talaga 'yung movie. May kaguluhan talaga siya. It’s about problematic relationships and about compromise.”
How is it working with JC? “Frst time naming magkapareha at maganda ang timpla ng movie namin kasi may halong comedy and kilig factor.”
Do they have love scenes? How did she handle them? “Nag-jell agad kami so walang awkwardness sa amin. Maayos ang rehearsals namin before each take with our director, Denise O’Hara. We became close friends while doing this movie. The name of my character is Alex at si JC naman is Carlo. I’m in love with him but I found out that he is not ready to seriously commit to a relationship. So I ask myself if love could survive without commitment and I offered na kami muna habang di pa talagang kami.”
Looks like she’s getting to be more daring after she did “Project Feb. 14” for iWant streaming where she had torrid scenes with McCoy de Leon. Her leading man now, JC, is more used to doing daring roles, just like in “Open” and “Don’t Call Me Tita” where he had butt exposure. How about her?
“May butt exposure din siya rito,” she laughs. “At ako rin, meron. Abangan nyo. Ha ha ha!”
