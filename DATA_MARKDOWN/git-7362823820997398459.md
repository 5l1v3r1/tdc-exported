Thailand's government has officially reopened the cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach were trapped during a rescue saga that received worldwide attention last year.
Approximately 2,000 visitors flocked to the reopening of Tham Luang cave on Friday, hoping to be the first to enter the world-famous site in Chiang Rai, according to the Bangkok Post.
It had been closed to visitors since members of the Wild Boars youth soccer team were trapped for 17 days in the flooded caverns nearly 15 months ago.

More than a million people have visited the cave over the past year, although no one has been able to go inside due to restoration efforts, according to the Bangkok Post.
On Friday, the outlet reported that 20 people were admitted at a time inside the cave's mouth and the first chamber. The attraction was open between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
“We have allowed visitors to see the mouth of the cave,” said Kamolchai Kotcha, director of the local conservation office that oversees the cave told the Japan Times.
