The makers of 'Pati Patni Aur Woh' released the trailer of their film on Monday afternoon in a grand fashion and gave the audience the much the first glimpse of Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday's characters.
While the trailer launch which was attended by the cast and crew of the film, what grabbed everyone's attention was Kartik's response when he was asked about the 'Woh' in his life. Answering the question, he said, "There's no one in my life but Chintu Tyagi has Ananya and Bhumi in his life. Not only 'Woh' but there's no 'Patni' as well in my life." While he was trying to answer this question, producer Bhushan Kumar and his co-stars seemed to be having a gala time seeing him struggle.
The young millennial actor's relationship status has become the talk of the town since his breakup with Sara Ali Khan. Not only that but reports of him dating co-star Ananya have also been making rounds on the internet.
Directed by Mudassar Aziz, 'Pati Patni Aur Woh' which is slated to release on 6th December is a remake of 1978 Hindi film with the same name.
