Superstar Salman Khan sure knows how to make an entrance! The star, who kickstarted shooting for his Eid 2020 release ‘Radhe’, made a rather dramatic entrance on the sets as he arrived for his first day of the shoot.
Proving that there is no one quite like him, Dabangg Khan walked on-set in slow motion while putting on his suit jacket. Making sure not to reveal his look in this upcoming cop-drama, the actor only gave fans a good look at his back and a glimpse of the sets that appeared to be some sort of restaurant setting.
