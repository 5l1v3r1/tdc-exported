JAKARTA – US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday Washington’s review of a trade preference facility for Indonesia will conclude soon and predicted “far more investment” by US companies in the Southeast Asian country.
“I think we’ll see far more investment from American companies and far more bilateral trade than exist right now,” Ross told reporters after a meeting with Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesia’s chief economic minister.
