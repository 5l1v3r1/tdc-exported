WWE has been on the move over the past year in terms of resigning talent. Several Superstars have chosen to rejoin the company, which is a good thing for WWE, especially since the rise of All Elite Wrestling.
Now another star has decided to return, as Randy Orton has signed a contract extension with WWE. The Viper posted the news on November 5 via Twitter, where he revealed that he will be part of Vince McMahon’s company for the next five years.
While WWE fans are likely happy with this news, the same perhaps cannot be said for AEW fans. Orton teased a jump to Tony Khan’s company in October, which was echoed by The Revival, who have aligned themselves with The Viper in recent months.
