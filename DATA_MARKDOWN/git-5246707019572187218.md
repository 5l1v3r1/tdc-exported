Despite the fact that the Switch is in full swing and how offers an entry-level option in the form of the Switch Lite, Nintendo's Doug Bowser continues to refuse to call time on the console's forerunner, the 3DS.
The veteran handheld is selling dismally, software support has effectively ended (at least from Nintendo's standpoint) and services are slowly but surely being cancelled. Despite all of this, Bowser maintains that the 3DS remains a viable 'entry point' for younger players.
Speaking to The Verge, he said:
When quizzed at what point it could be said that the 3DS is finally dead as a platform, Bowser replied:
On one hand, of course Bowser isn't going to come out and declare the 3DS done and dusted â€“ not while Nintendo still has inventory of the console it wants to shift over the festive period. But in the cold light of day, the machine has little in the way of a solid future; software support has all but dried up and it's almost impossible to find brand-new versions of anything but the 2DS variants of the system now. Still, it has an amazing library of games, so that's certainly something.
Perhaps 2020 is when Nintendo will finally pluck up the courage to bid the 3DS family a fond farewell.
