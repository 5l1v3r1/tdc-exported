Warren faced criticism during the last Democrat presidential debate when she dodged questions over how she would pay for her single-payer Medicare for All plan. The Massachusetts Democrat unveiled her plan Thursday, in which she claimed that her plan would not foot the bill onto the middle class.
“Today, I’m releasing my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. Here’s the headline: My plan won’t raise taxes one penny on middle-class families,” Warren said. “In fact, we’ll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That’s bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history.”
