Chrissy Teigen has shared footage of her “wine drunk” husband, John Legend, performing a distinctly slurred rendition of his hit ‘All of Me’ during a night out at Universal Studios on Friday (November 1).
The 40-year-old singer surprised attendees by jumping on stage in a red onesie, embroidered with an image of Legend’s own face, and launching into the 2013 single. “John got wine drunk and sang a song at universal studios last night,” Teigen captioned the clip on Twitter, who can be seen laughing at the bravado performance while onlookers cheer him on. Watch the video below.
