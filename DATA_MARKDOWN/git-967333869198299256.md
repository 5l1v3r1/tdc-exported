        An FBI spokesperson explained that the man who painted this message about Russia allegedly controlling people via micro devices inserted into their ears appears to be suffering from some kind of mental illness.
      
A man who recently left a car with a cryptic warning painted on it next to the FBI office in Pittsburgh has finally turned himself in, according to local NBC affiliate WPXI.
The message painted on the manâ€™s car said: "Russia plants micro radio devices in ppls ears and controls them using a sound similar to a dog whistle. Subliminal hypnosis."
