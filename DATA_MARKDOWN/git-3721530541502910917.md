The opening ceremony of BlizzCon 2019, presented live from the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, is over. Here are all the biggest stories, including the first details for Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, new information on World of Warcraft’s next expansion, and the new autobattler mode coming to Hearthstone.
When Blizzard suspended Hearthstone player Ng “blitzchung” Wai Chung over his calls to liberate Hong Kong from Chinese oppression, it set off a chain reaction of negative feedback. That feedback showed up in force, with protestors showing up in person outside the convention center to make their feelings known.
Blizzard resident J. Allen Brack came to the stage himself — ahead of the final countdown that traditionally begins each keynote — to formally apologize for his company’s actions.
“I am sorry and I accept accountability,” he said in a visibly emotional address. “What exactly is our purpose? BlizzCon is demonstrating it as we speak. We aspire to bring the world together in epic entertainment. I truly believe in the positive power of video games.”
No mention of reducing blitzchung’s suspension further was made.
