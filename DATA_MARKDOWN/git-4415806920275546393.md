Two Celtic fans are in hospital after they were stabbed by masked attackers in Rome.
The incident happened outside the Flann O’Brien pub in the Italian capital on Wednesday night.
Celtic are due to play Lazio in a Europa League clash at the Stadio Olimpico on Thursday evening.
Italian police said the injured pair were taken to hospital for treatment.
One fan from Kilmarnock, who gave his name as Dennis, said: “We were just in the pub maybe the back of 11 last night and then maybe 15 or 20 Lazio fans, well I’m assuming Lazio fans, turned up with their masks on.
“They pen-knifed a guy, they stabbed a guy in the leg, now this man’s 53 or 55 years old, I’m led to believe, so that shows how cowardly they are, they’re targeting, without being disrespectful, they’re targeting the older generation.
