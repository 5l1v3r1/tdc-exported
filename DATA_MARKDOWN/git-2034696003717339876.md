Carly Simon has recounted the time she met Donald Trump at an event in New York, and found the current President of the United States “repulsive”.
Speaking to The Guardian in a new interview, the ‘You’re So Vain’ singer recalls the time she met Trump, then a reality TV star on The Apprentice in the US, at a luncheon for Benazir Bhutto, the late prime minister of Pakistan. “When I came into the room, there was Trump and a whole bunch of New York dignitaries. Trump wasn’t paying any attention to me at all. Why would he?
“Benazir Bhutto summoned me and asked me to go into the bedroom with her and so I went and we sat on the bed and she held my hands and said: ‘I just love your music.’ We talked about different songs that were her favourites and it maybe lasted three minutes.” Watch the video for Carly Simon’s biggest hit, alongside Bond theme ‘Nobody Does It Better’, below.
