It has been one hell of a week for hip hop. The surprise new Earl Sweatshirt album arrived today (along with a video for “East,” which you can watch below), and you can read more about that album, the first Gang Starr album in 16 years, and the somewhat hip hop-adjacent Sudan Archives and Michael Kiwanuka albums over in Notable Releases. Plus, we got the announcement that we’re getting a new Wiki album next week (and a new single), a new Vince Staples Show episode/song, a new Buddy album announcement and song, a new Miguel EP announcement and song; and singles from Kamaiyah, Junglepussy, Griselda, Clams Casino, dvsn/Future, Ariana/Nicki, Teyana Taylor/Kehlani, Young Thug/Travis Scott, AJ Tracey/Skepta, 21 Savage, and more. Read on for all the hip hop we posted on BV this week…

Earl Sweatshirt’s very good new project Feet of Clay is out today (read our review), and along with the release came a video for the accordion-fueled “East.”
