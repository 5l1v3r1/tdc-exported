Fortnite developer Epic Games has placed a lifetime ban on a professional player after he was found to be cheating in a series of videos shared online.
Jarvis Kaye, known in the Fortnite community as a member of the eSports team FaZe Clan, has shared the news online in a video released to his two million subscribers on YouTube. He notes that the ban has come in response to a series of his own videos in which he uses aimbots, cheating software that improves the accuracy of your shooting in-game.
In his emotional announcement, Kaye says, "All I was thinking about whilst I was making those videos was just how entertaining and interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch. It didnâ€™t even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life from Fortnite from those videos". He goes on to explain that he has never used the cheats in a competitive game mode and is left in tears as he highlights the fact that he'll never be able to play Fortnite again.
