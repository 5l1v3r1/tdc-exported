        Formula 1 star Charles Leclerc has launched a new venture in the form of a go-karting brand! The youngster has two Grand Prix victories to his name this season and has decided to return to karting, albeit at a very different angle!
      
Leclerc was a star in karts, winning multiple championships in France as a child, culminating in victory in the WSK Euro Series title.
In an Instagram post, he said: “I’m extremely happy to announce that I’ll now have my own karting brand.

        “I started racing 18 years ago dreaming of Formula 1, most of the best times I’ve had in motorsport are from the karting days but it’s also where I’ve learnt most.
      

        “It’s so good to be back in the karting world in a different way and I’m really looking forward to this new challenge.”
