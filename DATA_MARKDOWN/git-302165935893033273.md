PETALING JAYA, Nov 4 — An elderly kuih seller has been inspiring Malaysians online with his positive and hardworking attitude towards life.
Known as Pak Mail, the 73-year-old makes up to 2,000 pieces of jemput-jemput a day and sells them at 10 sen per piece at his roadside stall in Kluang, Johor every evening.
He’s even doled out food for free during Ramadan for the past five years as a way of giving back to his community.
When met by YouTube content creators FS Channel, Pak Mail said that he was thankful for his good health which enables him to continue working.
“Alhamdulillah, I don’t have high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems.
“My children don’t want me to continue doing this as I’m getting on with age, but selling kuih is my hobby,” he said in a video.
As he fried up the delicious morsels, Pak Mail shared how he was widowed 23 years ago and that he was left to raise his 12 kids by himself.
“I wanted to remarry but I had a lot of responsibilities, so I chose not to.”
