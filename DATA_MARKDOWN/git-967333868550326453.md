        According to Article 28 of the Paris Climate Agreement, a country can exit the deal as early as 4 November 2020, provided that its government sends a withdrawal notification to the United Nations one year prior to that date.
      
A US State Department official told reporters on Monday that Washington had notified the United Nations that it would exit from the deal, adding that this would mark the first formal step in a one-year process to exit the global pact to mitigate climate change.
