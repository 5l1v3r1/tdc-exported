        Earlier this week, Donald Trump disclosed the name of the canine injured in the US military operation that killed self-styled Daesh* 'caliph' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying that Conan the dog would soon pay a visit to the White House.
      
Speaking at a rally in Mississippi on Friday night, President Donald Trump specifically focused on a dog that took part in last week’s US special operations raid near the Syria-Turkey border to take out top Daesh terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
He also pointed to the fact that the story of the successful raid “disappeared so fast” and that he “didn’t do it for the story” to be covered by the media.
“I did it because it’s the right thing to do,” Trump pointed out, praising the US troops for the successful operation.
Trump underscored that “no enemy stands a chance against the righteous might” of the US military, reiterating that the Daesh leader was “cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior” before he was killed.
