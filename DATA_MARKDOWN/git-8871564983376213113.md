Prosecutors at the Denpasar District Court yesterday demanded Eric Roer, a Dutch national who is allegedly involved in an illegal wildlife trade of protected items from Bali, be sentenced to three years in prison. 
“Based on evidence and the facts from the Court, the defendant [should be] sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of IDR100 million (US$7,131),” prosecutor I Made Lovi Pusanawan said, as quoted by Kumparan. 
Roer is charged with violating articles from Indonesia’s 1990 Conservation Law for his alleged involvement in the shipment of protected items from the Southeast Asian country, including skulls of various animals like crocodiles and sea turtles, as well as snake skin. 
Roer has reportedly been sending handicraft items made from protected species through ocean freight shipping to the Netherlands since 2013. Police in Bali handed evidence of his crime to public prosecutors in August, around three years after they began investigating the case. 
Authorities previously said that the illegal items were sold for hefty prices abroad, between IDR50 to 80 million each, though they were purchased for only around IDR1 million each in Indonesia.
