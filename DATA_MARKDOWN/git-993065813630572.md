A man armed with a knife threatened a woman and stole her car during a hijacking in west Belfast.
The man approached the woman just after she got into her parked white Audi car on Sorella Street off the Falls Road shortly after 5pm yesterday.
He ordered her out of the car before driving off.
The car was later found at Cluain Mor Drive in the Beechmount area at around 5.30pm.
The woman was not injured but was left shaken following the hijacking.
The man is aged around 40. He is around 5' 8" tall with receding dark hair and a local accent. He was last seen wearing a dark anorak and dark trousers.
Police appealed to anyone with information or who saw the car travelling between Sorella Street and Cluain Mor Drive to contact them on 101.
