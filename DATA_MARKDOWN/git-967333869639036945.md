        The former ruler of Malaysia insists his ex-wife wants to use their failed marriage to gain fame and celebrity status and is publicly blasting her for making their marriage public without his consent. The former king denies that he abdicated the throne because of the marriage scandal.
      
Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan, the head of Malaysia’s Kelantan sultanate and former King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) of Malaysia has rebuked claims made by his former wife, Russian-born Oksana Voevodina, whom he married and later parted with last year that he fathered her son, the Daily Mailreported Monday.
In a harsh statement delivered by a palace source who spoke to the Daily Mail, the sultan said photos of Voevodina’s 5-month-old son do not prove that he is the father of the baby and the infant could be “the son of any Asian man".
