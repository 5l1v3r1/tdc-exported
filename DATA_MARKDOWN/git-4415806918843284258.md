A loggerhead turtle blown thousands of miles off route departed Cork Airport this morning for Gran Canaria.
Three weeks after being taken into care by Dingle Oceanworld Aquarium, the sea turtle was booked on the Ryanair flight to return it to more familiar waters.
The turtle was found in Galway by a local woman walking her dog on Roundstone beach and was brought to a vet in Clifden.
Mara the turtle, who turned out to be between five and six years of age, was cared for in Clifden where the vet gently brought Maraâ€™s body temperature back to normal after being in the cold waters of the North Atlantic Ocean for a prolonged period.
