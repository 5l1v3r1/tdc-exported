In case you wondered if Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan had relaxed his stance on attendees taking pictures and videos at shows since A Perfect Circle’s last tour, where dozens of people were ejected for taking cellphone pics, the answer is: doesn’t look like it! As Loudwire points out, ticketholders for Tool’s recent Cleveland, OH show received a pre-show email warning them against snapping pics for the ‘gram:
A redditor said the warnings continued with signs “posted at every spot possible” at the venue, and printed on tickets.
Maynard has a sense of humor, though; according to Alternative Press editor-in-chief Jason Pettigrew, who was in attendance, Maynard told the Cleveland audience they were “up to par,” and gave the okay for security to stand down and let people check their email.
Tool’s current tour, supporting Fear Inoculum, continues through the end of the month, including dates at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center and Newark’s Prudential Center. See all dates below.
