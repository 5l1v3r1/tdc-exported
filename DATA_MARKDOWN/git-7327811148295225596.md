JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- A high school community is saying a final farewell to Aamir Griffin. The teen was shot and killed last month while playing basketball with his friends in Queens.
The 14-year-old was not the target of the shooting.
His death has sparked calls for justice as police continue their search for his killer.
His funeral was held Monday morning at the Greater Allen Cathedral.
"He didn't deserve this. He was a good kid," said Delissa Chamble, a friend. "I know everybody is going to miss him."
His casket arrived in grand fashion, by horse-drawn carriage.
