England tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler has been knocked out cold while attempting a tackle in the third minute of the Rugby World Cup final against South Africa in Yokohama on Saturday.
YOKOHAMA: Springboks flyhalf Handre Pollard kicked four first-half penalties as South Africa took a 12-6 lead into the break in the Rugby World Cup final against England at Yokohama Stadium on Saturday.
England captain Owen Farrell replied with two of his own in a tense first half characterised by England errors after being placed under immense pressure by the South African pack.
Both sides were forced into making first-half replacements, with England tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler and South Africa hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi knocked out while South Africa lock Lood de Jager appeared to suffer a dislocated shoulder.
All three were injured while attempting tackles.
