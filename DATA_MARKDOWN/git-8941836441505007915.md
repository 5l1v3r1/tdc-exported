CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) - Clemson starting defensive end Xavier Thomas is expected to miss a third consecutive game since suffering a concussion at practice last month.
Tigers coach Dabo Swinney says Thomas has made significant progress since entering the concussion protocol before No. 4 Clemson’s 45-10 victory at Louisville three weeks ago. However, the team plans to hold him out Saturday against Wofford of the Football Championship Subdivision.
Thomas had started four of the team’s first six games before getting hurt. The 6-foot-2, 265-pound sophomore from Florence is third on the Tigers with 4½ tackles for loss.
Clemson (8-0) is looking for its 24th consecutive victory when it takes on Wofford (5-2).
