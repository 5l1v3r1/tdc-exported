OpenAI today published the final model in its staged release for GPT-2, the spooky text generator the AI community’s been talking about all year.
GPT-2 uses machine learning to generate novel text based on a limited input. Basically, you can type a few sentences about anything you like and the AI will spit out some ‘related’ text. Unlike most ‘text generators’ it doesn’t output pre-written strings. GPT-2 makes up text that didn’t previously exist– at least according to OpenAI‘s research paper.
