Frank Ocean released a Boys Noize-produced new single, “DHL”, a couple of weeks ago, and now he’s followed it with a second new song, “In My Room,” which you can listen to below.
Frank just held the third edition of his queer club night PreP+ at Knockdown Center’s BASEMENT on Halloween, where he previewed what is reportedly a new collaboration with Skepta, and dressed as Sweet Tooth.
