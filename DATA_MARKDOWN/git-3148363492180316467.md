“Wall Street and main street continue to awaken to the threat liberals such as Elizabeth Warren pose to our country’s successful free market economy,” Ortiz said in a statement. “Taxing successful entrepreneurs and small businesses, as well as all who create jobs and make our economy grow is a recipe for recession and economic calamity.”
Warren has been feuding with Cooperman for weeks.
In an October 16 interview on CNBC, Cooperman predicted that stocks would fall 25 percent if Warren were elected. A week later, he told Politico that Warren was soiling the American dream. That prompted Warren to respond by urging Cooperman, who pledged in 2010 to give his vast fortune to charity during his lifetime, to “pitch in a bit more.”
