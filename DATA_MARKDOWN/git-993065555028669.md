A dog which fell through ice into a frozen lake had a lucky escape after being saved by rescuers.
In a video posted on Facebook, rescuers from the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service in Canada can be seen boating out into the middle of the lake through a layer of ice before taking the dog back to land.
