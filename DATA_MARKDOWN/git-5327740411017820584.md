VANCOUVER — Jaden Schwartz scored at 3:28 of overtime to give the St. Louis Blues a 2-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday.
The winner came on a 3-on-0 after Vancouver’s Tyler Myers fired a shot that missed wide of the opposition’s net and went the length of the ice with three Blues chasing. Schwartz finished off a tic-tac-toe play alongside Alex Pietrangelo and Brayden Schenn.
Canuck goaltender Jacob Markstrom smashed his stick in anger after the goal.
Vancouver (9-3-3) rookie Quinn Hughes tied the game 1-1 with 3:35 remaining. Hughes sent a fluttering shot from the blue line that went over the shoulder of Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington. Elias Pettersson was screening on the play.
Tyler Bozak, with his first goal of the season, also scored for the Blues (10-3-2). Binnington finished the night with 33 saves and is 6-1-0 his last seven games.
It was the fifth consecutive win for the defending Stanley Cup champions, who are 7-1-0 in their last eight games.
