        MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Norwegian national Frode Berg, jailed in Russia on espionage charges, has requested a presidential pardon, and his application will be studied in accordance with the law, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Wednesday.
      
Berg, a retired Norwegian border agent, was detained in Moscow in late 2017 upon receiving documents that contained classified information concerning the Russian Navy. Last April, a Russian court sentenced him to 14 years in a high-security prison on espionage charges.
Berg has denied the charges, while his defence lawyer has said that he might have been used as a carrier of the classified documents by intelligence officers without being aware of it.
