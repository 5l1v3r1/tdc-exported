Scotland is set to be battered with heavy rain this weekend as a yellow weather warning from the Met Office has been issued.
Persistent and heavy rain on Saturday and into Sunday is likely to bring some disruption from flooding in the north east of the country.
Angus, Aberdeen , Moray. and the Highlands will all be affected with rainfall of up to 80mm expected in some places.
A Met Office spokesperson said: Persistent and occasionally heavy rain is expected to develop across northeastern Scotland on Saturday.
 
"Rainfall accumulations of 25 to 40 mm are likely through Aberdeenshire, eastern Moray and northern Angus and as much as 60-80 mm across Easter Ross and Caithness, perhaps a little more over high ground. Rain will lose intensity through Sunday.
"Flooding of a few homes and businesses is likely. Bus and train services probably affected with journey times taking longer, and spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer."
The yellow weather warning  will be in place from 6am on Saturday morning until noon on Sunday.
It comes as the Met Office issues "danger to life warnings" for wind and gales for parts of down south. However, Scotland will miss the worst of it.
