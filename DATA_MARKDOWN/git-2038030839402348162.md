Cape Town - Actress Jessica Nkosi and actor TK Dlamini had a very public breakup in August after Jessica accused TK of cheating on her.
Now, the couple seems to be on good terms again after a video of them dancing together surfaced on Twitter.
Throughout their relationship, the pair kept their relationship mostly under wraps, making their relationship public with the arrival of their first child together in October 2018.
In August, the actress told Channel24 that she ended her relationship with TK.
"I have made the decision to end our relationship. I am no longer with the father of my child," she said.
Rumours of TK's alleged infidelity first made headlines in July, when TK attended the Durban July solo.
The 28-year-old was quick to put out the rumours, telling Move!, "There's no such, it's all hogwash. We're together. We've never broken up."
Now, two months after they split, TK posted a video him and Jessica Nkosi enjoying themselves at a concert on his WhatsApp story.
The story was then reposted onto to Twitter.
