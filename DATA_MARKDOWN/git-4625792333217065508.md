Fox News has been the only cable news outlet to cover the recent revelation that ABC News didn't run an interview that anchor Amy Robach conducted with one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers years ago.
Project Veritas released a video Tuesday of Robach discussing the information she received years earlier from Virginia Roberts Giuffre on a hot mic.
She voiced her frustration about the network's refusal to run her story and claimed that Buckingham Palace had threatened ABC News after finding out that Prince Andrew was implicated in her reporting. She also expressed her belief that Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was found dead in his jail cell in August, was murdered because of what he knew about "powerful men," despite his death having been ruled a suicide.
"It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything," she stated. "I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it."
