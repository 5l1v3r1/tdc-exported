She said, "We've fulfilled half a month of an idol schedule, and we're getting through it on vitamins."Ga In continued, "Today, Narsha got a crick in her neck, so the manager had to use pressure to get it out. I think we have to rest. I have a feeling that we'll all be laying down for a week after our schedule is over." JeA added, "We still have some of our idol schedule left. We have to do a fan sign event. We're already taking omega 3."Have you seen Brown Eyed Girls' music videos for "Wonder Woman" and "Abandoned"?
