PHOENIX (AP) - A procession in Phoenix is planned for an Arizona jail officer killed by an inmate.
The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office says Officer Gene Lee’s body will be escorted from Banner Health Medical Center to the Maricopa County Medical examiner’s Office. The procession is planned for about 9 a.m. Saturday.
Jail authorities say 59-year-old Daniel Davitt knocked Lee to the ground leaving the officer comatose with a head injury.
Lee died Wednesday. He had been an officer at the Lower Buckeye Jail.
