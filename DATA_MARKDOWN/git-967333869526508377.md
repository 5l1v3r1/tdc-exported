        Unlike many entertainers working in the United States, neither Corden nor Orlando Bloom are known for having expressed any political affiliations in the past. This time, however, Corden has revealed they once confronted Ivanka over her father’s policies.
      
James Corden, the host of ‘The Late Late Show’ on CBS, has recalled a drunken plea he once made to US ‘first daughter’ Ivanka Trump.
The revelation came in the ‘Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts’ segment of his late-night show, where two people get to either answer personal questions or eat one of many nasty dishes. This time, among the picks were bird saliva, a chopped-up bull’s penis, and a bug trifle topped with a scorpion.
“You recently attended a wedding that was also attended by Ivanka Trump, what did you talk about?” guest Arnold Schwarzenegger asked as one of the questions (time code 6:00 for mobile phone users).
