Netflix’s “The King” debuted on Nov. 1. The movie is loosely based on both a series of plays by William Shakespeare (the “Henriad”) and the life of England’s young King Henry V in the early 1400s.
Timothée Chalamet﻿ stars as the titular king. The promotional materials made it seem like Lily-Rose Depp and Robert Pattinson also star. In reality, Depp and Pattinson appear in the movie for about a collective five minutes. The rest of the 2 hour, 20 minute runtime mostly involves Chalamet engaged in confusing conversations while wearing “king” clothes in dark, candle-lit rooms. I know this because, along with my colleague Bill Bradley, I watched the entirety of this mediocre movie. We have some thoughts.
Read on for our brief conversation. You can also watch the trailer, which showcases pretty much the entirety of Pattinson’s and Depp’s performances.
