Song after song, video after video, do constant pop-up and pre-roll ads ruin the moment?
As of today, users in Southeast Asia can return to the days when YouTube was much less annoying by signing up for its premium service. YouTube Premium, formerly known as YouTube Red, officially launched this morning in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and also Hong Kong. 
YouTube Premium subscribers get ad-free entertainment that can be downloaded and watched offline, as well as songs that can be played in the background. They also get YouTube-produced originals such as Cobra Kai, the critically praised, ongoing story of The Karate Kid; murder-mystery reality series Escape the Night and Jordan Peele’s sci-fi anthology Weird City.
