        Ben Fucking Gibbard!
      
Lana Del Rey and Ben Gibbard duetted on Death Cab For Cutie track ‘I Will Follow You Into The Dark’ together at Denver’s Bellco Theatre last night (November 4).
Del Rey has been touring her latest album ‘Norman Fucking Rockwell!’ throughout the US, and brought out two musical guests for her latest stop in Colorado. Gibbard played a solo set before Del Rey’s show, and later returned to cover his band Death Cab For Cutie’s 2005 hit ‘I Will Follow You Into The Dark’ alongside the ‘Venice Bitch’ singer. Watch a video of the performance below.
