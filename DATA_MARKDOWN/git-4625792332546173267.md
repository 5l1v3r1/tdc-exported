President Trump called Fox News pollsters “lousy” and suggested the network find better people to run their presidential polling amid data showing nearly half of American voters support impeachment.
During a gaggle on Sunday, Trump was asked if he is confident that he will win reelection in 2020 despite the impeachment proceedings that are underway. He claimed that his internal polling was strong.
“I’m very confident,” Trump said. “Our poll numbers are great. We’re doing very well in the polls.”
Trump noted that internal impeachment polls have been “very strong” in favor of keeping him in office despite several recent polls showing the country split evenly about impeachment.
“You’re reading the wrong polls,” Trump said after being asked about the divide. “Let me tell you. I have the real polls.”
The president claimed polls from CNN were “fake” and continued to question Fox News as well.
“The Fox polls have always been lousy,” he said. “I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.”
