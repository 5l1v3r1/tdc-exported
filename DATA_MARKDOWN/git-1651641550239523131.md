        Gio Corsi, Head of Global Second Party Games at PlayStation and avid supporter of the PlayStation Vita, has announced his departure from the company.
      
Corsi had been at the company for six years. During this time, he originally occupied the role of Senior Director from 2013 until April 2018, when he was appointed Head of Global Second Party Games.
“It’s been a hell of a ride but last week was my final one at PlayStation. I’m taking some time off but I will be back in games soon enough.” Corsi said in a thread on Twitter.
