Ricky Gervais is known for his edgy, in-your-face humour. Some people thought dressing up as a man declaring himself a woman was way too edgy, but quite a few appreciated the joke.
“I was going to dress up as something weird and creepy for my Halloween party, but I’m bucking the trend this year and I’m going as brave female activist Jessica Yaniv,” Gervais wrote on Wednesday alongside a close-up photo of the transgender woman. “This also means I don’t have to wax my big old hairy [expletive].”
