Rep. Eliot Engel, theÂ Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, forcefully opposed the impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton -- but in an interview Sunday, he struggled to explain why the current inquiry against President Trump is a meaningfully different situation.
Appearing on ABC News' "This Week," Engel, D-N.Y., who leads one of the four panels probing Trump, looked on stone-faced as anchor George Stephanopoulos showed Engel a clip of his 1998 argument against impeachment.
"No one believes that the president will ultimately be removed from office, so we will have dragged this country through a six-month trial in the Senate, and Bill Clinton will still remain president," Engel said in the clip. "What good does that do?"
"Aren't we facing a similar situation right now?" Stephanopoulos asked.
