        The prospect of Boris Johnson keeping the keys to No 10 and signing a deal to leave the EU by 31 January has been welcomed by many City institutions, with many weighing in on how snap elections in December would affect UK markets.
      
UK prime minister Boris Johnson has launched fresh snap elections set for 12 December aiming to secure a parliamentary majority that would back a no-deal Brexit, prompting fierce debates in the City of London.
Currency traders were also among those to view a Tory mandate as positive news for the UK, sending the value of the pound to $1.287, making a rise of 6% over the last four weeks.
But A "Boris Bounce" is expected if Mr Johnson launches a series of tax cuts aimed at attracting multinational firms in addition to further spending on the NHS, education and police forces.
Several economic analysts have mulled the impact of the British Prime Minister retaining his seat at Downing Street, as well as how the elections will affect UK markets, for better or worse.
Analyst Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank said that investors would back Mr Johnson as No 10 to "put the UK on the path to an orderly Brexit on 31 January 2020" and mitigate risks UK Labour and opposition leader Jeremy Corby could pose as Prime Minister, damaging the UK "with left-wing economic policies".
