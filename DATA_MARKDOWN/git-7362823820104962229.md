With wildfires ravaging many parts of California, President Trump put pressure on Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday morning by suggesting there won't be any more federal funding to battle the wildfires unless the state improves its forest management system.
In a series of tweets Sunday morning, Trump wrote that Newsom, a Democrat, has "done a terrible job of forest management."
