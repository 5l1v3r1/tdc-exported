        Sebastian Vettel qualified in 2nd for the Mexican Grand Prix after a largely positive Saturday for the German. The battle for third in the drivers' standings is very much alive with just 16 points separating Charles Leclerc, Vettel and Max Verstappen with three races remaining.
      
Vettel feels that being on the front row may not be a bad thing after Kimi Raikkonen's performance last season.
“It’s not bad being on the front row here, as was proved by Kimi’s start last year, "Vettel said following qualifying.
"It will be important to get everything right at the start and not make any mistakes when it comes to our tyre strategy.
"We saw last Sunday that sometimes taking a risk can pay off, so we will study the situation very carefully before the start.
“Unfortunately, I was a bit too aggressive and maybe the track had got a bit slower and that’s where the time that might have put me on pole, escaped me."
