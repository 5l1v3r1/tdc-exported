ROME: It may sound like science fiction, but in a few short years the family dinner table may be laden with steak from a printer and other proteins produced from air, methane or volcanic microbes.
With the explosive success of vegan beef and burger substitutes developed by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, the alternative protein sector just keeps growing.
According to investment bank Barclays, alternative meat sales could reach US$140 billion - or 10 per cent of the global meat industry - within a decade, or a 10-fold increase from current levels.
A new generation of products in the works melds cutting-edge technology with age-old fermentation processes to turn otherwise harmful or everyday elements into essential food ingredients, with the aim of reducing agriculture's massive carbon footprint.
According to the United Nations, agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for 23 per cent of total net manmade greenhouse gas emissions from 2007 to 2016, soaring to 37 per cent when pre- and post-production activity were factored in.
Livestock meanwhile are responsible for about 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
Enter Solar Foods, a Finnish company working on an edible protein powder called Solein which uses water, air and renewable electricity as a way to separate food production from agriculture.
