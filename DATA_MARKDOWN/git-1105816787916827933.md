ISLAMABAD  : Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday warned the opposition not to mistake the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government as weak.
The minister took to social media and said the government is exercising self-restraint – over the protest led by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, pressurising the premier to step down – on the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“Don’t dare to underestimate PTI government, we are exercising self-restraint because Imran Khan has desired so,” he wrote.
The federal minister also noted that if the premier wanted, he could make a phone call to deal with the matter, warning the Azadi march leaders – including PPP, PML-N and JUI-F – that they would not find any place to hide.
“If he makes a call these bunch of opportunists will not find a place to hide in Pakistan.”
