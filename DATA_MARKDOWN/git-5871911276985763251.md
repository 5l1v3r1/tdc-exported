        Another episode of NWA Powerrr is in the books and this time out, a championship changed hands, legends returned and the company’s top stars stepped up in the spotlight once again.
      
Colt Cabana was out first, hyping his upcoming National Heavyweight Championship match against Jams Storm. Colt’s promo was followed by Aaron Stevens, who talked about his recent loss to Ricky Starks.
Stevens said he petitioned the NWA to get a rematch, one that was more benefiting of the company’s tradition. Aaron then said he was actually related to William Shakespeare and quoted the bard before ending his promo.
A “commercial” featuring Nick Aldis was shown next, promoting RetroMania Wrestling, a new game coming to consoles in 2020.
