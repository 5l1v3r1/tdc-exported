        The star of Kimmy Schmidt, 30 Rock and new period drama Dickinson discusses a career spent playing narcissists – and some very strange souvenirs
      
There were two reasons that Jane Krakowski signed on for Dickinson, the new comedy-drama in which she plays the mother of the great American poet Emily. One was that her own mother was a fan of Dickinson’s work, so much so that the young Krakowski could recite a few of the poet’s greatest hits by rote. The script, then, immediately piqued her interest. “It’s changed now,” she explains, “but in the original, it started with: ‘I’m Nobody! Who are you?’ And she reads the whole poem. At the end she looks into the camera and she goes: ‘I’m Emily. I’m Emily fucking Dickinson.’ I was like, wait. What is this?” She smiles: “This is not your mom’s Emily Dickinson.”
Krakowski also wanted to play a character who would be entirely unlike two of her best-known roles, 30 Rock’s Jenna “Listen up fives, a 10 is speaking” Maroney and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’s Jacqueline White/Voorhees, another of her immaculate, iconic narcissists, a spoof of the 1%. They are two of the greatest comedy characters of recent times.
