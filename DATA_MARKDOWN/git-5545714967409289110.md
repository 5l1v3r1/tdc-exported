Square Enix is giving Dragon Quest Builders 2 fence-sitters a chance to play the game for a matter of "hours" with a new Jumbo Demo that's out this week on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
The demo doesn't just span the introductory Isle of Awakening â€“ it also lets you loose in the next zone, Furrowfield, and your save data will transfer to the full version of the game should you opt to buy it.
