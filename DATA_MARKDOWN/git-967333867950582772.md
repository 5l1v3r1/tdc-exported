A New Zealander accused of murdering 22-year-old Grace Millane, from England, has gone on trial in Auckland.
The 27-year-old cannot be named in New Zealand after a judge granted a name suppression order but his identity is already in the public domain because numerous British newspapers and websites published it  last year.
Prosecutor Robin McCoubrey said Grace and the man met through dating app Tinder and went out on a date on 1 December 2018 during which they were seen kissing.
