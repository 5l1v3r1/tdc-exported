        According to the 2020 presidential candidate, Warren's $52 trillion healthcare plan envisions replacing private health insurance with a fully government-subsidized one. To guarantee the plan, Warren vows ''not to raise taxes one penny on middle-class families'' and instead to hit US billionaires.
      
2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who comes from the so-called ''progressive wing'' of the party, came under attack both from opposing Republicans and fellow Democrats for her 'Medicare for All' plan, while the popular TV show ''Saturday Night Live'' also made a parody of her healthcare proposals.
Warren has been continuously criticized for failing to provide a detailed explanation for how she is going to pay for her healthcare policies, while her new plan released on 1 November claims to avoid increased taxes on middle-class citizens.
