Contra: Rogue Corps was admittedly not the game the majority of fans were hoping for when Konami announced a new entry in its popular run and gun shmup series. Its combat was clunky and slow, the levels were incredibly bland, the objectives were boring, and it had low-resolution visuals and muddy textures. We could go on, but you should probably read our review if you want the full breakdown.
If you were expecting some of these areas to be improved in a future patch, you might have to wait. The first major update has just dropped since the game's release in September and instead of some much-needed quality of life improvements here and there, the game has received a sizable content update. While it may not necessarily be what we were hoping for, it's at least free to download.
This update adds new hardcore missions that are recommended for experienced players. These two new areas include Carving Adventure and Megaton Skyscraper. Check out the clips below:
