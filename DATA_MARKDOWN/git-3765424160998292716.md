MDC leader Nelson Chamisa has accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration of committing a silent genocide through its failure to address the challenges facing the health sector.
Said Chamisa, “It surprises me that the Mnangagwa regime would fire medical doctors instead of simply paying them a living wage. These are fruits of illegitimacy. There is a silent genocide taking place in Zimbabwe as our hospitals have been shut down for 2 months now. Pay doctors a living wage!”
On Tuesday Health Services Board fired 77 doctors out of 80 who were arraigned before a disciplinary hearing.
Doctors have organised a solidarity protest meeting to be held at Parirenyatwa hospital on Wednesday.
