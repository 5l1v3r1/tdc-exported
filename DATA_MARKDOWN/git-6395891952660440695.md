MANSFIELD, Mass. - A Mansfield auto mechanic has died more than a month after suffering severe burns in a fire that destroyed a popular gas station where he worked. 
Ron Stanovitch, a mechanic at the station, was involved in a welding accident when the fire started, authorities said. 
Loyal customers of Canaan Fuels in Mansfield were in disbelief in the days after fire burned out of control at the gas station.
"I couldn't believe it, Mike's always been busy down there,' customer Tommy Glavin told Boston 25 News at the time. "[I] can't believe what happened."
Stanovitch's niece posted to a community Facebook page after the incident:
"My family thanks Canaan Fuel employees for your heroic acts, the quick response from our public safety and the continued thoughts, prayers and contributions from the community," the post read.
She went on to say that Stanovitch had surgery and would be sedated for several months.
Officials at Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed to Boston 25 News Wednesday that Stanovitch had passed away.
