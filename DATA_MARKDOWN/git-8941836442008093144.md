TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Police in Tucson continue to search for the driver of a pickup truck involved in a fatal hit-and-run crash involving a pedestrian.
Officers responded to the collision Friday night and say 59-year-old Mark Anthony Valenzuela has been identified as the victim.
They say Valenzuela was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.
Tucson TV station KOLD reports witnesses at the scene told police the male driver didn’t stop after the collision.
Police say they’re looking for a large, dark-colored pickup truck, fitted with off-road tires.
Investigators found metallic navy blue vehicle parts at the scene that are believed to belong to the vehicle.
Police say based on roadway evidence, they don’t believe speed was a factor in the collision.
