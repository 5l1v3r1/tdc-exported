        Bitcoin transactions have been exploding recently, and the network managed to collect over half a million in fees within only 24 hours.
      
The last several days have been pretty happening for bitcoin. This time, the benchmark cryptocurrency did not see a massive surge that added thousands of dollars to its price, but it did make a few milestones, of sorts.
Only a week ago, on October 30th, the bitcoin network surpassed $1 billion in cumulative fee revenue, which is quite an important milestone.
