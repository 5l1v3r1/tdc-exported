If Se7en has taught you one thing, it’s not to ask what’s in the Mysterious Box, but that’s exactly what we are going to do in this guide to get Izanagi’s Burden. With the launch of the Black Armory came the forges and within the forges there were three exotic weapons; Jotun, Le Monaqrque, and Izanagi’s Burden. The first two can be found through random drops when completing different Lost Forges, but Izanagi’s Burden is going to take a little more than simply participating in the events.
For quite a while during Season of the Undying a bug meant that acquiring Izanagi's Burden was impossible. The issue related to a particular Forge activity, the completion of which is essential in picking up the supremely effective exotic sniper rifle. As of November 7, 2019, a hotfix now means that Forge keys count towards the Mysterious Box as they should.
The first step in getting Izanagi’s Burden is to find the box in which it resides, the Mysterious Box. You’ll find the box hidden just outside of the Volundr Forge in the European Dead Zone, within a cave on the cliff’s edge on the left side prior to jumping across the broken bridge.
