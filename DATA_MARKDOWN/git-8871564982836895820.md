Hong Kong democracy activists donned Halloween masks lampooning the cityâ€™s pro-Beijing leaders last night, defying an emergency law that bans face coverings and sparking renewed clashes with police.
Online forums used to organize the largely leaderless movement encouraged supporters to use a night when revelers traditionally embrace costumes to mock a recently enacted ban on face masks at protests.
Flashmob rallies broke out in multiple locations, hours after the city announced it has plunged into a technical recession for the first time since the global financial crisis over a decade ago.
