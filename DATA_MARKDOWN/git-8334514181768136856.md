BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese President Michel Aoun and caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri held talks on Thursday on responding to three weeks of nationwide anti-government protests that have thrown the country into its worst crisis in decades.
In a statement, the president’s office said the two discussed the “general situation” and efforts toward “finding a solution to the current government situation”.
Hariri, who stepped down a week ago but remains in a caretaker role, has been exploring the possibility of forming a technocratic government, with fewer cabinet posts allotted to the country’s large number of sectarian groups.
