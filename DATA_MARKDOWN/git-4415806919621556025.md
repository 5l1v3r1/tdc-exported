A young woman who wanted a “romantic picture” in front of the Eiffel Tower has gone viral with a photo of her kissing a stranger.
Kristiana Kuqi, from Kosovo, had completed a semester abroad at Reading University when she made plans to meet a boyfriend in Paris and travel across Europe. However, after they broke up she had to rethink her plans.
Ms Kuqi, who has since graduated from Randolph College in Virginia, told the PA news agency: “I’ve always wanted a picture kissing at the Eiffel Tower. So I get there with one of my girlfriends and we were taking so many pictures – it was my first time in France.
“I’m looking around and I see a gorgeous guy and think to myself, ‘You need the romantic picture you’ve always wanted and now’s the chance’.
“I tell my friend my idea of asking this guy for a kiss and we are both kind of freaking out about it. So I just approach him and asked ‘Hey do you speak English’. He replies ‘yes’, then I ask ‘do you have a girlfriend?’, and he says no.
“So I look at him, trying my best to keep my cool and ask, ‘Will you kiss me right there in front of the Eiffel Tower for a picture?’ and in the coolest manner he says ‘Yes, of course’. So that’s how it started.”
