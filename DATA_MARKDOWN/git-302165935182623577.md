ALOR SETAR, Nov 6 — A total of 39 fishermen were arrested in the Rintis Perdana operation conducted by the Kuala Kedah Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) and the Kota Setar District Anti-Drug Agency (AADK) in Kuala Kedah waters here on Monday.
Kuala Kedah Maritime Zone director Maritime Commander Mahmad Faizal Ahmad said 42 fishermen underwent urine test and 39 of them tested positive for morphine and methamphetamine.
