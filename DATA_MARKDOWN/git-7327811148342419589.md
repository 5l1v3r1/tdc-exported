MIDTOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- President Donald Trump is back in New York City - attending a UFC fight at Madison Square Garden.
The President had seats on the floor. Sitting on one side of him was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. On the other side of him were his sons, Donald Jr., and Eric.
Long Island Republican Congressman Peter King was also there.
Hundreds of people protested outside The Garden shouting things like 'lock him up.'
Some also held signs reading 'headlock him up' - a reference to the UFC fight he came to watch.
The President is expected to spend the night at Trump Tower, likely making further traffic complications when the Marathon takes place.
The President's visit to the city comes just 48 hours after he switched his residency from Manahttan to Palm Beach, Florida.
