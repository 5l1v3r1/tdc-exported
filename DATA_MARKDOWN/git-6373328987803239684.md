        Robert Pattinson’s caped crusader could be the toughest yet: he’s preparing for The Batman with Keanu Reeves’ trainer for the John Wick films. 
      
As starry names flood Matt Reeves’ superhero cast for the 2021 movie, simply named The Batman, the High Life actor has been busy training with Rigan Machado, an 8th degree red and black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, who just happened to train Keanu Reeves for the John Wick movies.
Machado confirmed their allegiance recently on Instagram in a post (which has now been taken down) with the caption: ‘Batman is coming’.
