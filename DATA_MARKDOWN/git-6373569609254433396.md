A Plymouth man has appeared in court charged with throwing bleach at a woman and her two-year-old daughter.
The 33-year-old faced city magistrates accused of attacking the mum and toddler intending to seriously injure them.
He answered two charges of throwing a corrosive fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable the pair on March 24.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is also accused of assaulting the mother causing actual bodily harm.
He also faces a charge of affray and causing criminal damage to the childâ€™s property on that same day.
The man did not enter any pleas.
Magistrates heard that the case was so serious that it could only be heard by a judge.
The defendant was released on unconditional bail to appear at Plymouth Crown Court on December 9.
