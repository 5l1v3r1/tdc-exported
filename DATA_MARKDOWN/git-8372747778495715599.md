CHARLOTTE COUNTY, Fla. — Charlotte County Sheriffs arrested a man for child pornography and felony warrants out of Georgia.
Police say, Nathan Potter, 37, was packing up his belongings when he was arrested.
A few months before Potter’s arrest, Canadian police found out Potter had coerced a juvenile to send nude photos to buy using two apps, Sketch, and Discord.
Potter gained more photos of the Juvenile by threatening to share the other photos online.
Canadian and Georgia Police contacted Charlotte County Detectives.
Potter will face local charges before his extradition for his crimes in Georgia.
Potter is charged with Possessing Photographs of Sexual Performance by a Child and Compiling Computer Pornography Involving a Minor.
Both charges are third-degree felonies.
