NEW DELHI: Having already received flak for his shot selection while batting, India wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant again became the talking point for his schoolboy error during the second T20I of the three-match series against Bangladesh in Rajkot on Thursday.
The incident took place in the sixth over of the Bangladesh innings when the opener Liton Das charged down the track to hit a big one off Yuzvendra Chahal. Liton failed to connect the ball and Pant wasted no time to whip off the bails but what followed next left everyone stunned.
The replay showed that when Pant collected the ball, some part of his gloves was in front of the stumps. The result was - third umpire flashed 'not out' on the big screen and on-field umpire called it a no-ball as Bangladesh got a free-hit.
