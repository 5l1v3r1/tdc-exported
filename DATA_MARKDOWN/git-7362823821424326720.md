House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Friday said she is “not a big fan of Medicare-for-all” -- but a resurfaced clip from a 1993 news conference showed her advocating for a single-payer health care system.
In a Friday interview with Bloomberg’s “Balance of Power,” Pelosi said she supported the idea of universal health care, but she parted ways with multiple presidential candidates from her party who’ve called for plans that would eliminate private health insurance for Americans.
“I’m not a big fan of ‘Medicare-for-all,’” she said. “I welcome the debate. I think that we should have health care for all. I think that the Affordable Care benefit is better than the Medicare benefit,” she said, a reference to ObamaCare.
