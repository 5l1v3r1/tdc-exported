Researchers have escalated their claims about market manipulation in winter 2017, now claiming that a single whale was responsible for Bitcoin’s historic price surge. The development was reported by Bloomberg on Nov. 4.
John M. Griffin and Amin Shams — of the universities of Texas and Ohio respectively — have updated their previous research, which made the case that market misconduct was allegedly behind Bitcoin’s bull run to an all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. 
Griffin and Sham’s analysis, first published in a research paper in June 2018, had argued that transaction patterns on the blockchain suggested Tether had been used to provide price support and manipulate the Bitcoin market:
Rather than indicating demand from cash investors, they argued that these patterns aligned with a “supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency prices.” 
In an update to their previous research, the academics are intensifying their argument, which is set to be formally published in a forthcoming peer-reviewed paper for the Journal of Finance. 
They reportedly argue that an analysis of Tether and Bitcoin transactions from March 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018 consolidates their view that a single entity — transacting via Tether’s sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex — is behind the manipulation:
The academics continue to claim that:
Tether’s General Counsel Stuart Hoegner has rebuffed the academics’ claims, releasing a statement that their research is “foundationally flawed” and derives from an insufficient data set. 
He has further alleged that the research was motivated to bolster a “parasitic lawsuit” against Tether, Bitfinex and the latter’s operator, iFinex.
