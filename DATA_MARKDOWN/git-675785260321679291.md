A seven-year-old girl is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest while trick-or-treating.
The little girl was out enjoying Halloween dressed as a bumblebee when she was hit by a stray bullet.
She was trick-or-treating on the Southwest Side of Chicago at around 5.30pm local time when the gunfire broke out.
The Chicago Police Department said a group of at least three men opened fire on a 31-year-old man, the New York Times reports.
A spokesman for the fire department said the girl was shot in the upper chest and remains in a critical condition.
 
A man in his 30s was also struck on the left hand.
A witness, Lali Lara, told the Chicago Tribune she heard a man screaming, "My little girl's been shot!"
However, it's been reported the man and girl were not together.
Lara told the Tribune she rushed the little girl and her family inside the store, adding "Everybody was in shock.
“I was pressing on her and calling her name so she won’t close her eyes.
"She was looking at me, and I was calling her name.
"She was holding my hand for three minutes and then she let me go.
"I have kids - I would go crazy if something happened to my kids."
A police spokesman said on Twitter the girl was not the intended target.
