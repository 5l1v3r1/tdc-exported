The comments, which were made by campaign spokesperson Sawyer Hackett, were shared in an official Castro campaign email sent to reporters on Tuesday. Hackett said:
“Secretary Castro will continue to raise issues others are afraid of, speaking up for the most vulnerable Americans, and showing voters why he’s the best candidate to take on Donald Trump,” he added.
A Tuesday evening report from Politico announced that Castro was laying off campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina in order to focus his narrow resources in Iowa and Nevada.
In August, Castro claimed President Donald Trump was “racist” who wants a “white, wealthier nation.”
