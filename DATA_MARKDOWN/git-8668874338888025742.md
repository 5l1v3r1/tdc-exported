There has been a lot of talk regarding England head coach Eddie Jones’ contract in the past few days, as discussions about his future with the Rugby Football Union are yet to be made. 
Jones is fresh from leading England to the Rugby World Cup final, where they were beaten by the Springboks 32-12. He is contracted with the RFU until 2021, but it is unclear what the future holds for him, particularly with the risk of knee-jerk reactions after such a loss. 
With his native Australia also without a coach following the resignation of Michael Cheika, Jones will be in high-demand. There is also the question of whether he will want to rebuild a team after coming agonisingly close to winning, particularly as this was his second final that he has lost in his career (the first with Australia in 2003).
