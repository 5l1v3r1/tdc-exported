Gareth Bale is back in training but will once again be missing from the Real Madrid squad to face Real Betis.
The Wales forward, constantly linked with a move away from the Bernabeu, is still building up his fitness following injury, according to manager Zinedine Zidane.
Bale, 30, flew to England earlier this week fuelling more speculation that he could leave in January.
