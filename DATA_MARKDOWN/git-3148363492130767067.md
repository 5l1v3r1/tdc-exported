Maher asked Farrow, who is best known for helping uncover the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal, whether Clinton could have survived in today’s political climate of hyper-awareness about sexual misconduct.
“I think that it is very important to interject that Bill Clinton is a different conversation,” responded Farrow. “He has been credibly accused of rape. That has nothing to do with gray areas. I think that the Juanita Broaddrick claim has been overdue for revisiting.”
Broaddrick, a former nursing administrator, first made the allegations against Clinton in 1999, claiming that he raped her in her hotel room in Little Rock in 1978, when he was Arkansas attorney general and running for governor. Clinton has denied the allegation through his attorney.
