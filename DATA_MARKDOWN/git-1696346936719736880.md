        Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has moved boldly with another prediction. This time, seeing Bitcoin hit $16,000 soon.
      
Binance’s CEO has been one of the most influential voices in crypto, though not without critics and detractors. But CZ remains bullish on his Twitter channel, recently making a prediction for BTC to drive to a high not seen in more than 18 months.
