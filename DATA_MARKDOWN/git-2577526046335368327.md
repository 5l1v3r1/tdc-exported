Multiplayer is coming to Mario Kart Tour, but if you want to be among the first to try out the mobile version in the way it’s arguably meant to be played, there’s a chance you’ll find yourself disappointed - unless you’re willing to pay.
Last night, the game’s official English language account tweeted to confirm that “a real-time multiplayer beta test is planned for December.” More details, and presumably an exact timeframe, are expected soon, but that tweet revealed that only those who have subscribed to Mario Kart Tour’s £4.99 monthly Gold Pass will have access to the initial test.
