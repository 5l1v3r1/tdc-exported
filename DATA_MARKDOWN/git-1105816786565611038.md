WASHINGTON: The United States is researching the new leader of the militant Islamic State (IS) to determine his previous roles in the organisation, Nathan Sales, the US counter-terrorism coordinator, said on Friday after a US raid last month killed its former leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
“Any time there is a leadership transition in the terrorist organisation, we want to make sure that we have the latest information that we need to have to confront the threat,” Sales told a briefing.
Islamic State, in an audiotape posted online on Thursday, confirmed that Baghdadi was killed in a weekend raid by US special forces in northwestern Syria. It vowed revenge against the United States.
The group, also known as ISIS, said a successor to Baghdadi identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi had been appointed. Earlier on Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted: “ISIS has a new leader. We know exactly who he is!” he said, without elaborating.
