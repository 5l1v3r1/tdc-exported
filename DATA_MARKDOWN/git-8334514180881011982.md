PARIS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Wednesday that France would set immigrant quotas for professionals, marking a precedent with a measure long sought by the country’s right-wing parties.
Better regulation and curbing of immigration is a topic that President Emmanuel Macron has said would be at the heart of the next presidential election in 2022.
“Our will is to make choices in how we welcome (the migrants): set quantitative goals or quotas, both expressions suit me, for professional immigration”, Philippe told a news conference.
