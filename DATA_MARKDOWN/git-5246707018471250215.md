After teasing the game for a very long time, Goichi "Suda51" Suda and Grasshopper Manufacture finally lifted the lid on No More Heroes 3 earlier this year at E3. It's aiming for a 2020 release and sees Travis Touchdown return as the beam wielding professional assassin.
If you've been wondering how development is going, Suda says the game is "about 35 to 40 percent complete". It will be an open-world title once again, but due to Grasshopper being a "middle-class" sized studio, Suda says it won't be on the same scale as other open-world games from publishers such as Ubisoft and Rockstar.
On a lighter note, motion controls will make a return:
And one of the bosses in the game is best described as a combination of Thanos, Venom, and Joker.
