The latest batch of My Nintendo game discounts for Europe has now gone live, giving players the usual chance to grab a handful of games at reduced prices.
There are five discounts up for grabs this time around, all for the 3DS - as has been the case for a while now. As always, you can take advantage of these discounts by simply using the required Gold or Platinum My Nintendo Points listed below; New Super Mario Bros. 2 for just £19.99 and Animal Crossing: New Leaf for just £9.59 sound particularly tasty.

        Will you be taking advantage of any of these offers? Remember, your Gold Points can also be spent on Switch software directly from the eShop or a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, too.
