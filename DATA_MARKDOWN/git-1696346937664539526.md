        Recent reports have surfaced about an anomaly within the Robinhood trading application that has let users make crazy money.
      
Cryptocurrency market critics often complain about the lack of security and worry about the users potentially cheating the system. However, as it turns out, the stock market is not always as safe as many would like to believe, either.
A recent glitch in the Robinhood stock trading app allowed users to misuse the margin trading feature, and borrow up to $1.7 million for stock investing, even though they originally had only around $2,000. The leverage used by some of the traders goes all the way up to 500x, which is far from what the exchanges usually allow.
