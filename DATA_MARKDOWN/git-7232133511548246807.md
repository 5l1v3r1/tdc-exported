Earlier this month, NewsBTC reported that the market capitalization of all crypto assets, Bitcoin included, printed what is known as a death cross in the land of technical analysis. The ominous-sounding title is given to when a short-term moving average of any asset – the 50-day MA for example – crosses under a long-term moving average such as the 200-day MA. It signifies that bears are in control. 
It seems that the recent surge, however, is negating the potential long-term downtrend this death cross can have on this market. In fact, a golden cross has rapidly started to form after the aforementioned death cross.
As pointed out by Brave New Coin’s crypto analyst, Josh Olszewicz, the total cryptocurrency market cap – the value of Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies – is about to form a golden cross. In this case, the golden cross will see the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) cross above the 200-day exponential moving average.
This will signal that the downtrend has most likely ended at $7,300, and may imply that investors will continue to push the crypto market higher into the coming months.
