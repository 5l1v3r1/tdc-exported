ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Authorities say a New Mexico State Police officer shot and killed a 22-year-old man during a traffic stop after the driver attacked the officer with a knife.
State police say the officer shot Benjamin Diaz on Friday morning west of Alamogordo. Police say Diaz had emerged from his vehicle with the knife before the officer opened fire.
Police say the officer was treated at a hospital for stab wounds and released. Chief Tim Johnson did not provide details on the officer’s injuries.
Johnson says Diaz was pulled over after driving nearly twice the speed limit in a 60 mph zone.
Diaz is from Las Cruces and died at El Paso University Medical Center.
Police say they’ll turn over their investigation to a prosecutor when it’s completed.
