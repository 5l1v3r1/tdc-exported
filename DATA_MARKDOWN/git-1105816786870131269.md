NEW YORK: Donald Trump Jr released a book on  Tuesday that rails against the left as he admitted he had caught the political bug and may consider running for office in the future.
In ‘Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence US‘, the president’s son fiercely defends his father and slams mainstream media and political opponents including Hillary Clinton.
“This is the book that the leftist elites don’t want you to read!” screams a blurb on Amazon, adding that “no topic is spared from political correctness.”
Trump Jr dedicates the 300-page part memoir to “deplorables,” a clear dig at Clinton who used the term to describe Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The book quickly rose to third on Amazon’s list of bestselling books after the president on Monday encouraged his 66.5 million Twitter followers to order a copy.
“A great new book that I highly recommend for ALL to read,” Trump tweeted.
