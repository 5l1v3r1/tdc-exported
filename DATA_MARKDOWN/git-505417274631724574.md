        Jorge Masvidal is the official owner of the esteemed title of ‘baddest motherf*cker in the UFC’ after he defeated Nate Diaz via doctor stoppage at UFC 244 in New York City last night.
      
Masvidal and Diaz put on an instant classic as expected at Madison Square Garden despite the finish, which came at the end of round three, not quite being a popular choice with the fans.
‘Gamebread’ was coming into this fight off the back of the promotion’s quickest ever knockout over Ben Askren in July, but it was Diaz who looked as though he had control early, walking Masvidal down in his typical style.
Masvidal settled however and after getting locked in the clinch he hit Diaz with a big inside elbow which cut the Stockton native, before a head-kick knocked him to the mat.
Diaz was bleeding heavily but showed his patented endurance as he and finished strong in the opening round before entering the second with big pressure once again.
It was Masvidal again though who was doing the damage with a number of big shots to the already crimson face of his opponent before a huge kick to the body rocked Diaz.
