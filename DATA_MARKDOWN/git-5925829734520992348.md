If you use your Surface as a notepad, you’ll know that any delay in “ink” output totally throws off the precision of your markings.  Despite all the benefits of paperless note-taking, it’s undeniable that it’s much harder to produce a legible document using an electronic pen.
After introducing the Surface Studio, it became pertinent for Microsoft to resolve the latency issues with the Surface Pen.  The company has since mentioned a software-based solution that can be used to display the virtual ink faster.
The system works by familiarising itself with the way the user writes, so it can predict the user’s desired outcome:
If successful, this software could ultimately facilitate society’s transition from paper-based to more futuristic, sustainable storage solutions.  Until then, it’ll help you to keep notes that are actually neat enough to read once over.
