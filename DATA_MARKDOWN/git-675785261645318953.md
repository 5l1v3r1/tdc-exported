A huge lorry fire shut down large parts of the M6 motorway in both directions this morning causing miles of tailbacks.
Fire fighters were called to the fire which took hold between junction 2, Coventry, and junction 1, Rugby, at around 3am this morning.
Great clouds of smoke filled the air and severely reduced visibility on the motorway.
Diverted were diverted away from the fire, which caused both north and southbound parts of the road to shut,
