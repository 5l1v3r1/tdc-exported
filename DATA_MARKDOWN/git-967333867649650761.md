Turkey will send the Daesh* prisoners it has captured back to their home countries, the country's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said.
The minister also said that Turkey won't accept Europe's inaction on the issue of Daesh* prisoners when Turkey is left alone to deal with them. 
Turkey has captured some escaped Daesh* prisoners in northeastern Syria during its Operation Peace Spring which started on 9 October. Ankara said the operation was essential to oust Kurdish militants and Daesh* fighters from the border area and establish a security zone for Syrian refugees there. 

        *Daesh (also known as IS/ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State) is a terrorist group banned in Russia
