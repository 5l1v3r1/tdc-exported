After years of waiting, the motorcycle enthusiasts likely get to see the production version of the Hero XF3R concept at EICMA 2019. The stunning concept was first seen at the Auto Expo 2016.
Ever since, there have been several rumours and false alarms about the launch of the Hero XF3R, but with the streetfighter expected to debut at EICMA today and the day is not far before it is launched in the market.
In India, the production version of the Hero XF3R will rival the likes of KTM Duke 250, TVS Apache RR 310 and Bajaj Dominar 400. The upcoming motorcycle will become the new flagship from Hero MotoCorp and might even give birth to newer body types based on the same platform. Other than the aforementioned motorcycles, the new model will even take on the Benelli TNT 300 in the form of a cheaper alternative.
