My weekend with the Nioh 2 beta did not go as smoothly as I hoped it would, but I'm not giving up yet â€“ it's not over until November 10. I don't know if I'll "get good" in time, but I'll settle for adequacy.
If you're struggling to survive against that dang weasel, or the no-good snake, or any of the other monstrous threats staring you down in Nioh 2, I feel you. Here's enough inspiration for both of us: a complete beta boss rush cleared with Level 1 character stats and gear. No armor, no magic, no problem.
