BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials say the country’s main port has reopened after being blocked by protesters for five days.
The officials said scores of trucks were picking up imports Thursday from Umm Qasr port in the country’s south. The port houses a vital oil terminal and is an entry point for food and basic goods.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
Iraq has been gripped by protests in the capital Baghdad and across most of its southern provinces. Scores of people have been killed by security forces.
The protests are a continuation of the economically-driven demonstrations that began in early October. They’ve since turned deadly as security forces cracked down, using live ammunition.
