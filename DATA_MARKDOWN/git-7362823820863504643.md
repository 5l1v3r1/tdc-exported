Seth Meyers is known for mocking President Donald Trump on his late-night show. However, for his upcoming Netflix comedy special, he’s offering viewers the opportunity to skip past his political rhetoric.
Fox News confirmed that Meyers’ comedy special “Lobby Baby,” which debuts on Netflix Tuesday, will show those who tune in a button as soon as the topic shifts from the star’s personal life to politics. If pressed, the button will skip to the next segment in which politics aren’t discussed.

Unfortunately for those who are burned out on political jabs invading their entertainment, it doesn’t look like this feature will be a permanent feature in the streaming service’s application. A Netflix insider told Fox News it was a one-off feature for Meyers’ special and that it was actually the comedian's idea to include it as a sort of fourth-wall-breaking joke.
