In an effort to help businesses reach out to their customers easily, WhatsApp has announced Catalog feature for its WhatsApp for Business app.
The new Catalog feature will help customers learn more about the products and services that businesses offer, which, in turn, will help businesses attract more customers.
Customers can now see their full catalog right within WhatsApp, as opposed to businesses send product photos one at a time and repeatedly provide information.
For each item in the catalog, businesses will be able to add various information about their products and these include price, description, pictures, product code, etc.
To add a product, open WhatsApp for Business app, go to Settings, tap on Business Settings, and then select Catalog. In the Catalog page, you have the option to add products. Tap on the Add Product or Service option and fill up all the details about your product or service. In case you need step by step guide, you can watch the below video.
