Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has led a $5 million funding round for Arweave, a blockchain-startup focused on permanent online data storage.

From the perspective of AML, she said, when it comes to “moving to a decentralized system, I think we’re kidding ourselves if we think that’s going to change too much.”
