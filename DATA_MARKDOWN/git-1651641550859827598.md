Microsoft announced the Surface Pro X along with Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3 at their annual Surface Event in October. Among the new Surface hardware announced at the event, the Surface Pro X was the last one to go on sale. Unfortunately, the early reviews of the Surface Pro X weren’t as good as what Microsoft had hoped for.
The good news is, Surface Pro X scored well in one department, which is serviceability. This year Microsoft made a point of making Surface devices a little better in terms of repairability and Surface Pro X is no exception. Just days after the device went on sale, iFixit grabbed their tools to pop open the Surface Pro X. The device managed to score a decent 6 out of 10 on their repairability scale which is better than the previous Surface Go. The teardown can be summarised using the following bullet points.
