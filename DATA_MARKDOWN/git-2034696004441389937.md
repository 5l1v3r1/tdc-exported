Charli XCX was joined on stage last night by Christine and the Queens during her gig at Brixton Academy. You can watch footage of the moment below.
The pair first debuted their surprise collaboration, ‘Gone’, live at Primavera Festival earlier this year. More recently, the pair joined forces again in BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge to perform a special cover of The 1975’s ‘TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME’.
Reviewing her recent album, ‘Charli, NME said: “Christine and the Queens duet ‘Gone’ is a shimmering cut, with the pair trading vocals over glittering synths and a booming bassline, combining Christine’s warm funk tendencies with Charli’s icy vocals.
“…In the past it felt as though Charli was pushed in certain directions to enhance her clout in the pop game. ‘Charli’, though, sees her at her most comfortable and genuine; everything feels authentically her.Bold, brash and brilliant, this is Charli XCX at her most genuine, and it’s dazzling.”
