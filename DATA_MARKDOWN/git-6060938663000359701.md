Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar's upcoming film 'Pati Patni Aur Woh' have been the talk of the town since the announcement.
The trailer of the film received a lot of love from the audience. Now, Kartik is known for his monologues since 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama' days and the makers also incorporated a monologue in his upcoming film which didn't go well with the audiene.
In a particular scene of the trailer, the actor can be seen saying, "Biwi se sex maang lein, toh hum bhikaari. Biwi ko sex mana kar dein, toh hum atyachaari aur kisi tarah jugaad laga ke uss se sex haasil kar lein na toh balaatkaari bhi hum hain."
Everyone has criticised the makers and the whole team for adding this in the movie.
According to the latest report, the monologue will be edited from the film as it offended the masses. As PKP became a hit and one of the reasons was Kartik's monologue, makers of PPAW also thought to add in their film to attract the audience.
Meanwhile, the film helmed by Mudassar Aziz will hit the theatres on December 06 this year.
