In Kurt Sutter’s farewell email to the people who make the show Mayans M.C., he said that he didn’t know what FX had in store for the series but that co-creator and executive producer Elgin James “is ready to take on the challenge of running the show.” It turns out the network officially agrees. FX renewed Mayans for a third season today, despite firing Sutter recently, and James will step up and take over as showrunner. So that’s great news for everyone who gets to keep working on the Sons of Anarchy spinoff.
