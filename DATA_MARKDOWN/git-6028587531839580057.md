Topline: When billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer launched his 2020 presidential campaign in July, he centered his bid around getting corporate money out of politics because it “rigged the system”—but one of his aides reportedly offered money to local politicians in Iowa in exchange for endorsements, the Associated Press reported.
Crucial quote: “As a former legislator, I know how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa. It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable, and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part,” Murphy said in a statement.
Key background: Steyer founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. After stepping back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, he became a Democratic donor powerhouse, focusing on the environment and, most recently, a campaign to drum up public support for Trump’s impeachment. According to Forbes, Steyer is worth $1.6 billion is mostly self-funding his campaign. 
Tangent: Earlier this week, another Steyer aide in South Carolina resigned after stealing volunteer data from Senator Kamala Harris’ campaign, the Post and Courier reported.
