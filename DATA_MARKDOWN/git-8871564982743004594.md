A large number of Indonesians appear to be without internet this morning, as netizens have taken to social media to report that services by mobile internet provider Telkomsel and home internet provider Indihome — both operated by state-owned telco Telkom — are down.
Always ones to be hyperbolic in tense situations like this, mentions of Telkomsel and Indihome have skyrocketed on social media as netizens have been posting memes while waiting for their precious internet to be restored.
