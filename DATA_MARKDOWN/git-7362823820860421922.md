ABC News was criticized on Thursday for suggesting that the scandal involving Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., could have a negative impact on future female and "LGBTQ" candidates for office.
Hill, who is openly bisexual, made her resignation official on Friday after she was accused of having multiple inappropriate relationships with subordinates including her legislative director, which triggered a House ethics probe.
However, ABC News reported on Thursday that advocates are "raising concerns" that Hill's scandals will prevent other women and members of the LGBTQ community from being elected. Elliot Imse, the communications director at the pro-LGBTQ leadership group Victory Institute, said that the fallout from Hill "will give further pause to up and coming LGBTQ and women leaders."
