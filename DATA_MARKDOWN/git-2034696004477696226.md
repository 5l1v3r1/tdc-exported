        "I just wanted to make a movie exactly like the first..."
      
Director Roland Emmerich, who helmed the 2016 film Independence Day: Resurgence, has said that he now considers the sequel a mistake.
The sequel to 1996’s Independence Day, also directed by Emmerich, opened to poor reviews and holds a paltry 29% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It grossed $389.7 million internationally, far less than was hoped.
“It’s undeniably visually impressive, but like its predecessor, Independence Day: Resurgence lacks enough emotional heft to support its end-of-the-world narrative stakes,” reads the site’s critical consensus.
