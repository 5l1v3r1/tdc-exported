Aishwarya Rai Bachchan turned a year old on November 1 and celebrated her 46th birthday in Rome with husband Abhishek and daughter Aaradhya. From slipping into a dreamy satin dress for her birthday bash to touring the Italian capital like a tourist, Aishwarya and Abhishek treated fans with several clicks from their holiday.
The Bachchan family were snapped at the airport last night, returning home after their lavish rendezvous. At the airport, the couple was twinning in black while daughter Aaradhya was dressed in a white tracksuit.
On Aishwarya’s birthday, Abhishek had shared an adorable picture wishing his wife and the actress looked nothing less than a princess. Later, the actress had posted a series of pictures where the trio was seen exploring the city. On the work front, Aishwarya was last seen in ‘Fanney Khan’ along with Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao. The actress will reportedly feature in Mani Ratnam’s next ‘Ponniyin Selvan’.
