KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 — “If I’m in debt, I will pay; it’s my responsibility,” said Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali when asked about reported claims that he owed money to a travel firm that manages his and his family’s travels.
Azmin said this in response to media reports yesterday that a travel agency is taking him to court over RM328,901 in allegedly unpaid travel bills.
“I have not seen the summons writ. I have asked my officers to look into the matter,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the SDG Summit 2019 here today. — Bernama
