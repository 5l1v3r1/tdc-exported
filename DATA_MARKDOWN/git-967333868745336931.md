Hats off to Warner Brothers! Filming of the new Batman movie has not yet started, but people and fans of the franchise are already talking about it. First WB, which owns DC comics, stunned everyone when it cast lanky Robert Pattinson in the leading role, then they upped the ante by choosing Paul Dano to play the Riddler, one of Batman’s villains. Now they've decided to finish movie lovers and comic books fans as media reports now say Colin Farrell is in talks to play Oswald Cobblepot or The Penguin, while Andy Serkis is rumoured to be playing Bruce Wayne’s trustworthy aide Alfred Pennyworth.
The news has set social media ablaze with netizens arguing about WB’s choice, which many found incredibly weird. Some users thought it would be better if Farrell had been cast as Batman’s butler, while Andy Serkis, who is famous for his portrayal of eerie creatures, played the Penguin.
