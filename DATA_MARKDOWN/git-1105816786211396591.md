LOS ANGELES: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg had made it half-way from Sweden to Chile by boat, train and electric car when next month’s United Nation (UN) climate summit was unexpectedly scrapped.
But as a new venue was announced on Friday for the gathering called COP25 — this time in Spain — the 16-year-old didn’t bat an eyelid: she simply asked for a lift back across the Atlantic.
“As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help,” Thunberg tweeted from Los Angeles. “It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)”“Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November… If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,” said the teen, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved.
