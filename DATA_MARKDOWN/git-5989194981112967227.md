        Here's a word all book lovers need to know.
      
Deckare is the Swedish word for crime novels or other fiction; as you may have noticed, Swedish authors are fairly fond of these and the country has a strong tradition in detective fiction.
Although it usually refers to books, a TV series or film can also be a deckare. A similar English word would be 'whodunnit'.
