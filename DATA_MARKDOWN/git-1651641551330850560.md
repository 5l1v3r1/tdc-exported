Being the CEO of Microsoft has certain perks, including getting to try out the company’s recently announced dual-screen laptops and phone.
Satya Nadella said he wanted to carry around his Surface Duo and Neo everywhere, and shared some of his impressions of Geekwire, praising the device’s versatility and user interface.
He praised the device’s Pen-first “Moleskine-like” experience, saying it was an improvement on touch-first devices as it offered a real replacement for paper.
The idea of a pen-first operating system is of course very similar to the Courier concept, but what little we have seen of Windows 10 X suggests that it is still large designed for keyboard, mouse and touch.
