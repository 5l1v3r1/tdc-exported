(CNN) - More than 600,000 four-wheel drive trucks and SUVs are being recalled by General Motors because a software error could trigger the braking system and increase the likelihood of a crash, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Covered are the 2014-2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, the 2015-2020 Chevrolet Suburban, the 2015-2020 Chevrolet Tahoe, the 2014-2018 GMC Sierra 1500 and the 2015-2020 GMC Yukon models.
GM said more than 650,000 vehicles worldwide are potentially affected, the AP reported. No accidents have been reported.
The failure of a wheel-speed sensor can activate the braking software, leading to unintended braking on the opposite wheel, the AP said, causing the vehicle to pull to one side.
The risk can be eliminated by driving in two-wheel drive mode until the recall repair is made, GM told the wire service.
The reprogramming of the vehiclesâ€™ software will be done by GM free of charge.
