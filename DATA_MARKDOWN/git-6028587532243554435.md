Topline: Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, he announced on Friday, after he failed to gain momentum and enough funding to keep his campaign afloat.
Key background: O’Rourke sought to distinguish himself and gain momentum in the last months of his campaign by taking a strong stance on gun control in the wake of the El Paso shooting. Still, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg have surged while O’Rourke struggled to break out.
