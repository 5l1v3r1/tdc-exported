When most hungry drivers pop into a gas station, they’re not looking for delicious demonstrations of culinary prowess. But you’d be remiss to opt for potato chips or candy bars at the Chevron near the corner of Sherman Way and Whitsett Avenue. This pit stop is home to some of the best burritos in North Hollywood.
Cilantro Mexican Grill sits beside the shelves of convenience-store staples. There, Adolfo Perez, a chef who trained at Le Cordon Bleu culinary institute, makes burritos, tacos, tostadas, and more. His surf-and-turf burrito—a tortilla stuffed with beef, pan-seared shrimp, rice, and beans, then doused in cilantro pesto and homemade salsas—is a favorite. But diners also praise his carne asada, chicken al pastor, and the breakfast burrito options as well. Even the guacamole earns high marks at this roadside spot.
While the price of gas may be steep, the food at Cilantro is not. All of the menu items fall between $6 and $10.
