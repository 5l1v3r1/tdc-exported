The government in Delhi closed schools until November 5 and distributed five million masks as air pollution levels in the city were classified as "severe".
"Due to the rising smoke of straw in Delhi, the pollution level has increased a lot. Therefore, the government has decided that all the schools in Delhi will remain closed till 5 November," the city's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.
Kejriwal said the city had turned into a "gas chamber" and said it was important that people protect themselves "from this toxic air".
He said that farm fires from neighbouring states were sending smoke into the Indian capital.
