Indian roads are full of surprises, which is what also makes the roads one of the most dangerous places to be. On the public roads, be it a city road or a national highway, taking off the eyes from the roads or not paying attention for even a microsecond can result in mishaps.
This is why there are so many accidents reported from the public roads daily. Here is an incident where the driver of a Hyundai Elantra barely missed a two-wheeler rider on a Honda Activa. Who do you think should be blamed here?
The video posted by Anil Ct in a group shows a recording from a dashboard camera of a Hyundai Elantra. the location of the recording is the TCR-EKM highway in Kerala. The video shows a KSRTC bus cruising on the fast lane of the two-lane way, which is a common sight on the Indian roads.
The video further shows a Toyota Innova overtaking the bus from the left-hand side and the Hyundai Elantra blindly following the Innova to overtake the bus.
