The song is entitled This Is How (We Want You to Get High), and will be used in the upcoming romantic comedy Last Christmas. It is his first original track material to be rolled out in seven years, according to Digital Spy. Upon the track’s release, Michael’s sisters Melanie and Yioda, his father Jack and former collaborator David Austin expressed in a statement that they hoped fans would “rejoice” in listening to the song written with “immense passion and pride.” Advertisement Advertisement The romantic comedy Last Christmas is inspired by the iconic Wham! song of the same name, and stars Henry Golding and Emilia Clarke.
