Environmental activism group Extinction Rebellion has won a challenge in Britain’s High Court against police over a London-wide ban on protests.
Two senior judges have ruled that London's police force had no power to impose the ban under Section 14 of the Public Order Act because that part of the law doesn't cover multiple gatherings.
Activists protested at sites around central London for 10 days in October, demanding more urgent action to counter global warming.
The police say 1,832 people were arrested.
Many protesters were pre-emptively detained under the ban before they could take any action.
