Max Verstappen has hit back at Lewis Hamilton, calling the world champion “disrespectful”.
Hamilton, who is set to win his sixth title at this weekend’s US Grand Prix, opened the war of words with Verstappen after he took aim at the Dutchman’s driving in Mexico.
Hamilton claimed that he affords the Red Bull driver extra room in the fear of being “torpedoed” following their first-lap altercation last weekend. Sebastian Vettel was in agreement with the Briton’s remarks.
