I'll just say it: The King isn't very exciting until Robert Pattinson shows up as The Dauphin. I don't say that as a Twilight fangirl, or a Batman fan obsessed with everything he does until he becomes the Caped Crusader. I had high hopes for the Netflix movie but it was on the slow and dismal side until that shot of adrenaline showed up in a long wig with a heavy French accent.
I took four years of French in high school but I know that does not qualify me to tell a good French accent from a bad one. Fans out there seem mixed on Robert Pattinson's accent in The King -- some said it was perfect while others called it outrageous. All I know is that it was appreciated.
