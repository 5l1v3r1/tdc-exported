ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Prominent leaders from opposition parties have joined Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) on Friday for Azadi March rally in federal Capital, Islamabad.  
Addressing the rally, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President and Opposition Leader in National Assembly (NA) Shehbaz Sharif said that time has come to topple the ‘fake government’ of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The ‘selected PM’ has destroyed the economy of Pakistan and students are crying for the scholarships, he continued.
The PML-N leader said that inflation was at low level during ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s tenure and that the nation is cursing this incumbent government of PTI for not providing them promised relief.
