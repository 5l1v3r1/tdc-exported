The former Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has announced he is standing down as an MP after being thrown out of the Conservative Party for disobeying Prime Minister Boris Johnson over Brexit.
Hammond, who rose to prominence under David Cameron and then became Chancellor under Theresa May, had been out of favour since Johnson took over in Downing Street in July.
