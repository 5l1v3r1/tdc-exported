Alfredo Morelos has been named in the Colombia squad for their double header against Peru and Ecuador later this month.
Carlos Queiroz included the Rangers striker in his 34-man provisional squad for the two friendlies last week.
And the Ibrox striker has made cut for his final squad thanks to a blistering start to the season.
Both matches are set to take place in America with the first in Miami and the second in New Jersey on November 15 and 19.
The 23-year-old played twice for his national side during last month's fixtures against Chile and Algeria.
Morelos will be hoping to get a taste of more action but faces stiff competition as forwards Luis Muriel, Steven Mendoza, Róger Martínez, Luis Díaz and James Rodriguez have all been called up alongside the Light Blues attacker.
 
Morelos helped Steven Gerrard's men reach the Betfred Cup final at the weekend as he bagged a brace against Hearts at Hampden.
That means the talisman has now reached 20 goals for the season as he continues to impress for Rangers.
