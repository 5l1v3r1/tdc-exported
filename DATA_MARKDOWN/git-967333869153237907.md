        On 24 September, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry over a whistleblower complaint claiming Donald Trump had a conversation with Ukraine's Zelensky in July in which he pressed the latter to investigate potential corruption on the part of Biden's family, who reportedly interfered in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
      
The White House Office of Management and Budget's officials decided not to testify before the US House of Representatives as part of an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, an administration official said.
According to the official, Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought will not appear before the US House Committee on the impeachment inquiry to give testimony on the matter on Friday.
