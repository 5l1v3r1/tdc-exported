        Jarvis Khattri, a popular Fortnite YouTuber, has had a lifetime ban from the game imposed on him by Epic Games after using aimbots in the game’s Battle Royale mode.
      
However, there’s an unusual twist to this ban. While most players tend to get bans for giving themselves unfair advantages over others in order to get ahead competitively, Jarvis was using the software on a side account that has no association with the account he uses to stream and compete.
While the use of cheating software in Fortnite breaks Epic’s Terms of Service, Jarvis wasn’t intentionally using it to give himself an edge over others. Instead, he was just trying to make video content for his subscribers.
In an emotional apology video, Jarvis admitted that he made a mistake.
