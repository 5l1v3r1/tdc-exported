Calgary students paid tribute to veterans at two local cemeteries on Monday through the ‘No Stone Left Alone’ program.
The memorial foundation behind the program aims to build awareness of military service and sacrifice by bringing students to cemeteries and cenotaphs to place a poppy, and sometimes meet veterans.
On Monday, about 900 students from five Calgary schools took part in ceremonies at Burnsland and Queen’s Park Cemeteries.
Last year the organization worked with over 9,000 students across Canada, holding events in 105 cemeteries across Canada. For more information, visit the No Stone Left Alone Website.
