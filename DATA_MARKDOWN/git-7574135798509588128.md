Tool are on tour now with Killing Joke in support of their first album in 13 years, Fear Inoculum, which is not just good for a comeback album but on par with plenty of Tool’s classics and one of the best rock albums of the year so far. We caught the tour last night (11/3) at Chicago’s United Center, where Tool played the album’s first three songs (the title track, “Pneuma,” and “Invincible”) and the weirdo instrumental “Chocolate Chip Trip,” alongside classics like “Ænema,” “Forty Six & 2,” “Stinkfist,” “Schism,” “Parabola,” “Jambi,” “The Pot,” “Interolance,” and more. Pictures are in the gallery above. Videos of Tool and setlists for both bands below.
Tool’s tour treks on, and includes NYC-area shows at Newark’s Prudential Center on 11/16 and Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on 11/19 (tickets). All remaining dates are listed below.
