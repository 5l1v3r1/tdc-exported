Abhishek Bachchan shuts social media trolls like a pro and Monday saw the actor dole out a savage response to a user who took a dig at him. Abhishek had posted a cheery Monday motivation post on Twitter which read, “Have a purpose. Have a goal. Something impossible you want to accomplish, then prove to the world that it's not impossible." Replying to his post a social media user commented on Abhishek’s employment status and wrote, “What do you call a person who is happy on a Monday? Unemployed!" to which Abhishek replied, "Nah! Disagree. Somebody who loves doing whatever they are doing."
