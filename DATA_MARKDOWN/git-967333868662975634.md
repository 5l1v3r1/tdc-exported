A Weddel seal has been captured while purring in Paradise Harbour, Antarctica. The seal performed strange vocalisations that are reportedly used to communicate with other seals underwater. The strange noise in a way recalls the sound of starships in the Star Trek or Star Wars movies. Some commentators have even wondered if the seal isÂ echolocating while dreaming, or mixing snoring with echolocation.
