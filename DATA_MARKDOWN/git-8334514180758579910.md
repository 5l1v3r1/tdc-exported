MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Britain’s finance minister Sajid Javid said there would be room for tax cuts under new fiscal rules he outlined on Thursday, five weeks before a snap election.
“If we stick to these rules that I’ve set out today...we can afford some tax cuts,” Javid told an audience in Manchester.
