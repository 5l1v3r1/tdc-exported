Expect a big 2020 for UFC heavyweight Francis Ngannou.
Although Dana White wouldn’t confirm a title shot for the Cameroonian knockout artist, the UFC president said he has some ‘big fights’ lined up for ‘The Predator’ in 2020, teasing of a main event slot in France, where MMA will be recognized as an official sport by January.
“Yeah, exciting year for Francis, too, because, not only big fights for him, and potential title fight, but France,” White said in a recent interview with TMZ Sports (h/t Jon Fuentes of The Low Kick MMA). “We finally got France done. We’ve been working hard for a long time to get that place open for MMA, and we’ll do a fight there that, obviously, Francis will probably headline.
“And I don’t know if you watched the fight last weekend from Singapore, but the kid, [Ciryl] Gane, big badass heavyweight from France. No [they won’t fight each other], but they’ll both fight on that card.”
