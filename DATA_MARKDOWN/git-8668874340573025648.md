Racing 92 lock Leone Nakawara’s no-show to training since the Rugby World Cup is one story this week that could have major consequences.
The 31-year-old has failed to turn up to training following his two-week break after the tournament, and while it is believed that he is in Fiji building a house with his club’s consent, it was initially reported that the Parisian club were planning on firing him if he does not return.
While many people have sympathised with Racing 92, as Nakawara is an employee of theirs who they desperately need as they sit second from bottom in the league, this has sparked new concerns about the Top 14’s treatment of players.
Clubs in the Top 14 have long been criticised from not prioritising player welfare, which was glaringly shown recently when Thomas Ramos ran out for Toulouse only a week after being sent home from the France squad with an injury at the RWC.
