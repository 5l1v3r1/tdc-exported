Sonny Bill Williams will be playing in Super League in 2020.
Newly-promoted Toronto Wolfpack are closing in on the signing of the dual-code international, who played his last match for the All Blacks in the World Cup bronze medal win over Wales in Tokyo last Friday.
The PA news agency understands the 34-year-old centre or second rower has accepted the offer of a two-year contract from the Canadian club which will make him the highest-paid player in the history of either code.
It is understood the deal is in the process of being finalised and should be announced before the end of the week, ahead of his unveiling at Canada House in London next week.
Toronto owner David Argyle set his sights on Williams two years ago and the club stepped up the chase once they secured promotion after beating Featherstone in the Million Pound Game in October.
Head coach Brian McDermott flew to Japan during the World Cup to meet with Williams’ representatives and is thought to have held face-to-face talks with the player he believes can have as big an impact on Super League as David Beckham had with Major League Soccer.
As part of the deal, Williams will make history by taking a stake in the club ahead of their move onto the stock market.
