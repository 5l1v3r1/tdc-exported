According to media reports, the school authorities and local police received two calls about a bomb in the facility and a "group of several armed individuals," at around 15:30 pm local time.
Upon the arrival, the police placed a cordon around the school, while students of the two classes weren't able to leave the building after the evacuation was declared.
