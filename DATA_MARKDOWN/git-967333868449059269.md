        Kanye West has recently declared himself “unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time”, but he’s never said anything about his graphic design skills. Some people believe that his newest ‘Jesus is King’ merch is actual blasphemy.
      
Music fans are still wrapping their minds around Kanye West’s newly-released gospel-themed album, but the similarly devout merchandise has people either up in arms or down in stitches.
On Wednesday, Kanye dropped a set of t-shirts, shorts, crewneck sweaters, sweatpants, hats, and socks. Piety is a recurring motif in all of the pieces, which will run you from $60 to $260.
What’s drawn increased attention to the merch – apart from the usual lamentation about the prices – was the somewhat sloppy graphic design.
A handful of pieces feature stretched-out images of black and white Jesus Christ, complete with low-resolution prints and 90’s-style graphics. The whole line was apparently designed by AWGE, A$AP Rocky’s creative agency.
The ‘Jesus is King’ merch has come in for a lot of stick online. “This made me even more atheist,” one user wrote.
