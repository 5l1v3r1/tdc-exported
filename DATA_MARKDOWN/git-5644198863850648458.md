WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday (Nov 3) called on the whistleblower whose concerns prompted an impeachment inquiry to "come forward",Â appealing directly to the intelligence community employee in a stark departure from norms of conduct in such cases.
The Republican president is under increasing pressure as the House of Representatives forges ahead with its investigation of whether Trump solicited help from Ukraine as he seeks re-election next year. Leaders of the Democratic-controlled House expect to begin public hearings in the next few weeks.
