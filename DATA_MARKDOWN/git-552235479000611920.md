Celtic youngster Kundai Benyu has expressed his regrets over his loan spell at Helsingborgs, having failed to make a single appearance since Henrik Larsson quit the club.
The 21-year-old joined the Hoops in June 2017, and made his debut against Linfield in a Champions League qualifier.
Benyu made one league appearance for Brendan Rodgers that season before being loaned out to Oldham Athletic.
Benyu left Celtic in February to spend the 2019 Allsvenskan season at Helsingborgs, and from June he was working under club legend Larsson.
The former striker announced his departure on August 23 though and Benyu didn't make a single appearance after that.
With the end of the Swedish season his loan deal is at an end and he wrote on Instagram: "Thank you for everything to everyone at HIF.
"Unfortunately the last couple of months of my loan didnâ€™t work out as I hoped, maybe under different circumstances they would have.
"Good luck in the future."
In total Benyu made 10 Allsvenskan appearances, scoring once against Falkenbergs.
Helsingborgs finished the season seven points above the relegation zone in 10th place.
