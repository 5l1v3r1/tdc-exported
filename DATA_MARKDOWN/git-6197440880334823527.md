After reports last week, Google has confirmed this morning that it will acquire Fitbit for the sum of $2.1 billion…
Rick Osterloh put out a post today on Google’s blog to confirm that Alphabet has entered a “definitive agreement” to acquire Fitbit as it looks to bolster its wearables offering. Osterloh specifically mentions that the company is looking to “invest even more” in its Wear OS platform with this acquisition and bring Made by Google wearable devices to the market.
CNBC reports that Alphabet will shell out around $2.1 billion to acquire Fitbit which has become a leader in the wearable space, managing to hold its own against the Apple Watch and beat out Google’s own Wear OS to a healthy margin too.
Addressing privacy concerns, Osterloh says that, with wearables, Google will “be transparent” about the data they collect and why that data is collected. Google will not sell personal data to anyone and Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads either. Fitbit users will also be given the choice to review, move, or delete their data.
