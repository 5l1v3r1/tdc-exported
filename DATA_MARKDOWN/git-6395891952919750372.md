BOSTONÂ (AP) - Boston Police are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred blocks away from a recent double shooting that left one person dead.
Police say they were called Friday night to a report of person shot near 35 Paine Street, in the Roslindale neighborhood of Boston. Officers found an adult male suffering from what appeared to be a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The incident comes a day after police responded Thursday to a double shooting in the same neighborhood.
Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins has acknowledged an uptick in activity in Roslindale and her office is working with the Boston Police on both cases.
Police have not said whether the two shootings are connected. They're asking for the public's help in solving the crimes.
