Cape Town – Congratulations poured in from across the globe on Saturday after the Springbok team beat England to be crowned winners of the Rugby World Cup 2019.
Host of the Daily Show, Trevor Noah, had a particularly powerful message to the squad and his home country after the win. 
"To say we’re proud would be an understatement," he tweeted, before adding; "Congrats to a team that many wrote off just a year ago. Our captain took criticism from all sides but today, the Springboks are back on top of the world. Well done Bokke. You have made us all proud."
