MEXICO CITY: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Nov 5) offered to help Mexico "wage war" on its cartels after three women and six children from an American Mormon community were murdered in an area notorious for drug traffickers.
Gunmen ambushed the members of the LeBaron family - a large clan of Mormons who emigrated to Mexico in the late 19th century - as they travelled on a rural road on Monday in a lawless region between the border states of Sonora and Chihuahua.
Mexican officials said six children were wounded and another girl missing after the attack, which left the family's three cars riddled with bullets and utterly charred, as seen in images posted on social media by devastated relatives.
"If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively," Trump wrote in a tweet.
