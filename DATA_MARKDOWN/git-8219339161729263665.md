AirPods Pro bring a new form factor that includes an in-ear design. With that comes new parts to keep clean, and you’ll likely see them become dirtier than AirPods since they’re worn inside your ears. Even after a short time, AirPods Pro can get gunked up. Read on for how to clean your AirPods Pro and charging case.
Many were hoping AirPods Pro would come in black as well as white, but they launched in just white. While white looks simple and sharp, it shows dirt and earwax more easily. There’s also the in-ear tips to deal with now, and Apple has updated its guide on cleaning AirPods Pro, including the ear tips. Read on below for all the details.
If you end up with debris or build up down toward the charging contacts in your charging case, you could try a manual air blower before giving canned air a try. It’s best to refrain from sticking anything down toward the charging contacts to avoid damage. Head to your local Apple Store or AASP if you need more help than basic AirPods Pro cleaning.
