Authorities said two gang-related murder suspects, considered dangerous, escaped early Sunday from a central California jail through a hole less than two feet wide, according to reports.
The Monterey County Sheriff’s Office said the inmates managed to take advantage of a blind spot in the housing unit surveillance, as Fox 2 reported.
The jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles south of San Francisco, is surrounded by barbed wire; authorities told the news outlet that the inmates escaped through a hatch in an construction area where there isn’t any barbed wire.
Santos Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, had been jailed since 2018, and were awaiting trial on unrelated murder counts “along with numerous other felony charges,” a sheriff’s statement said.
Fonseca was being held on two counts of murder and attempted robbery on a $2.25 million bail, Fox 2 reported.
