We've seen some fatal cuties in certain other games in the past, but this one is perhaps the cutest of them all.
Following the release of the DLC fighter Terry Bogard in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the Nintendo Versus Twitter account has uploaded a few screenshots to showcase what exactly the pink puffball Kirby looks like as the iconic SNK character from the Fatal Fury and King of Fighters series.
Kirby's copy ability gives him Terry's cap, his long blonde ponytail, and even his leather gloves. It also allows him to perform the fighter's neutral special attack, Power Wave.
As previously noted, Kirby isn't the first character to be turned into a fatal cutie. There was a time when Terry himself was transformed into one in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy, as a result of a prank.
