        Man used electric shopping cart to get from one bar to another
      
A Louisiana gentleman who enjoys consuming large amounts of alcohol tried a novel way to avoid drunk driving charges or a DUI conviction.
Go barhopping in an electric shopping cart.
His method does not seem to have entirely worked out for him, despite being clever.
The Terrebonne Parish Sheriffâ€™s Office in Louisiana reports in this news release that one Brice Kendell Williams, 32, is charged with having removed the cart from a Walmart in Houma to a bar about half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away, during a drunken spree last Sunday.
