NEW YORK, Nov 8 — After announcing the vehicle years ago, Elon Musk revealed Wednesday in a tweet that the “cyberpunk” Tesla pickup truck will be officially unveiled on November 21.
Over the years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not been shy about talking up the company’s very first pickup truck; he’s described the model as “futuristic-like cyberpunk,” “an armoured personnel carrier from the future,” “heart-stopping,” and “the coolest car [he’s] ever seen.” After all this hype, Musk announced Wednesday that the time has finally come: The “Cybertruck” will officially be unveiled on November 21 in LA.
