NEWPORT, R.I.Â (AP) - A Rhode Island man and his wife have been arrested for locking their 2-year-old son in a bedroom and leaving him home alone.
The Newport Daily News reports 37-year-old Lazaro Shemeley and 25-year-old Leah Shemeley were charged with cruelty or neglect of a child on Friday.
A judge issued both a no-contact with the child order.
Lazaro Shemeley was initially arrested on a domestic disorderly conduct charge. Leah Shemeley reportedly left the couple's child at home to attend her husband's arraignment Friday morning.
She told police she left the child with a babysitter, but authorities received a call about a crying child apparently left at home.
Leah Shemeley said she'd return home immediately after learning police were with her child.
It couldn't be immediately determined if the couple had a lawyer.
