        In the past the DUP and its main rival, the Ulster Unionist Party, had an unofficial electoral pact which meant they did not take Protestant votes away from each other in Northern Ireland. If the pact is abandoned it could allow Sinn Fein and other parties to win at the expense of pro-British parties.
      
The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Steve Aiken, is coming under pressure to change his mind after he announced earlier this week he would field candidates in constituencies where they had previously stood aside for the DUP.
A letter from prominent unionists, printed in the Belfast Telegraph, has called on Mr Aiken not to field a candidate in North Belfast, a marginal where DUP MP Nigel Dodds only had a slim majority over Sinn Féin's John Finucane at the last election.
