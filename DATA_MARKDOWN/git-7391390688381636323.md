Welcome to the welcome back parade, My Chemical Romance. On Dec. 20, MCR will reunite for a concert at Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles. This will be their first live show together since 2012. If you want to know how to get tickets to My Chemical Romance’s reunion show, look no further than the band’s Twitter account. MCR tweeted on Thursday, Oct. 31 that tickets to the concert will go on sale Friday, Nov. 1 at noon PST. The tweet also included a link to the AXS page where the tickets will be available. Be sure to set an alert and create a bookmark so you do not miss your opportunity to get first dibs at the tickets. The Dec. 20 concert is the only reunion date MCR has announced so far.
My Chemical Romance started in 2001, and the band went on to release acclaimed albums like Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and The Black Parade. A dozen years after the group began, they decided to call it quits: My Chemical Romance announced on their website on March 22, 2013 that “it has come time for it to end.” And now it has come time for their breakup to end.
