On Thursday, Bungie dropped hotfix 2.6.1.1 for Destiny 2. Bungie built the new patch to make some of Destiny 2’s current pain points — mainly how luck-based the late game power grind is — a bit smoother.
The most important change in the patch adjusts the new pinnacle power system. Pinnacle items now drop two points higher than a player’s average, rather than just one.
The new pinnacle power system is a grind only for the most dedicated Destiny players. Once a Guardian reaches 950 power (the max for most items), pinnacle drops are the only gear items that can push them past it. Pinnacle drops only come from Destiny 2’s most relevant activities (defeating the raid or completing a holiday event), and previously only dropped one point higher than the average — 951.
In order to start getting 952 drops, a player had to have all 951 gear. This led to some luck-based frustration, where players would miss out on one gear slot for weeks without moving up a level. The pinnacle max of 960 was mathematically impossible to reach over the three month season — barring perfect luck.
