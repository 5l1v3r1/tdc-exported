Back in December of last year, Nintendo Switch players were treated to a beautiful platforming adventure called GRIS. Our most dedicated readers will likely remember it well; we awarded it a mighty nine out of ten in our review, calling it a masterpiece.
The game has a very clear and unique aesthetic which is immediately recognisable in its art and animation, and its publisher, Devolver Digital, has noticed some very familiar-looking work residing in another project. A self-care app called 'The Fabulous' appears to use near-identical animations, and Devolver has highlighted that fact in the tweet below, saying that GRIS has been "ripped off".
