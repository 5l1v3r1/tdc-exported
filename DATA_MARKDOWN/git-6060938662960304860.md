PUNE: Rohan Bopanna on Tuesday expressed "surprise" and "shock" over All India Tennis Association's (AITA) decision to change the captain of the Indian Davis Cup team while still awaiting the final decision of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) on the venue of the November 29-30 tie against Pakistan.
The AITA named former Davis Cup player and chairman of national selection panel Rohit Rajpal as the captain, replacing Mahesh Bhupathi, on Sunday, a day before the ITF announced its decision to move the tie out of Pakistan. Pakistan, being the host nation, has the right to pick a venue in the next four-five days.
"It surprises me that AITA has changed the captain before ITF announced the final decision yesterday (04.11.19) and where the tie would be held. What shocks me more is that none of the players were asked or even informed that the captain was going to be changed," Bopanna posted on his official twitter handle.
