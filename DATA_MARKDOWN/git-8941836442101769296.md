RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) - Consultants are recommending that Pennington County add inpatient psychiatric beds at Regional Behavioral Health Center in Rapid City.
Behavioral Health Services director Dr. Katy Sullivan says the consultants from the National Council for Behavioral Health took a look at the community and the availability of mental health services and recommended adding 30 inpatient beds.
KOTA-TV reports the consultants’ report listed 12 additional proposals dealing with mental health. They include bolstering the existing system of recovery housing and employment support and adding more case managers to specialty courts that deal with drugs, drunken driving, veterans and mental health.
