Topline: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recruited two former Twitter employees to access private information from Twitter accounts to benefit the Saudi Royal Family and the Saudi government, according to Justice Department charges unsealed Wednesday, raising concerns that U.S. technology companies might be vulnerable to foreign governments. 
“We would like to thank the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice for their support with this investigation. We recognize the lengths bad actors will go to try and undermine our service. Our company limits access to sensitive account information to a limited group of trained and vetted employees,” a Twitter spokesperson said. 
Key background: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been accused by cybersecurity researchers of conducting a sophisticated spying operation aimed at dissidents’ private communications before. Forbes reported last year that it purchased a program from Israeli cybersecurity company NSO Group to hack the phones of human rights workers, journalists and activists, including those in contact with Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
