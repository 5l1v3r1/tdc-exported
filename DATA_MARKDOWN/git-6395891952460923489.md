Deputies said they were called shortly before 12:15 p.m. to the Magic Kingdom after Brian Thomas Sherman placed his arm around the costumed character's shoulders and groped her breast.
Sherman and his wife were escorted into a meet and greet area, and they sat on either side of the victim, an arrest report said.
The report said Sherman sat down beside the victim more quickly than she expected.
"This left the victim physically stuck in between the defendant on her left and his wife on her right," according to the report.
The report said Sherman repeatedly told the victim that the character she was playing is his favorite, and he placed his arm around her shoulders.
The victim said she was trained to know that it is inappropriate to be photographed with a visitor's arm wrapped around her and that she was uncomfortable but was unable to move, the report said.
It said Sherman moved his arm lower so that he could cup the victim's bra with his hand.
