The games industry hasn’t exactly been rushing out releases that offer ray tracing support. In fact, to date, there’s only a handful that officially allows you to get the best potential from your Nvidia 20XX RTX graphics card.
With both AMD and Intel expected to release their own hardware dedicated ray tracing solutions in 2020, however, things are undoubtedly set to get far more interesting in the very near future.
If you are the owner of an Nvidia 20XX graphics card and have so far been disappointed with the RTX supported releases, then you may have one eye on upcoming games that are touting ray tracing as a key feature.
In a list we plan to update regularly, however, you can below check out some of the biggest upcoming game releases with ray tracing support confirmed!

Release date: April 16th, 2020.
