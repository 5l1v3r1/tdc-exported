The attorney for the whistleblower whose complaint is at the center of impeachment proceedings against President Trump is warning that political figures need to hold back on naming his client.
The whistleblower’s attorney, Andrew Bakaj, made the remarks in a long Twitter thread Tuesday evening and come a day after Sen. Rand Paul called on the media to publish the name of the CIA officer who filed the complaint. The Kentucky Republican also said the whistleblower should be subpoenaed by Congress.
“I urge all of our government leaders - notably all Members of Congress - to step back and reflect on the important role whistleblowers play in our constitutional republic's ability to oversee itself,” Bakaj said.
