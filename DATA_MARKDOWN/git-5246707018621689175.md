No matter how famous people become, it's always nice to see how they can still become normal, grounded people when the time is right – like when you're approached by the president of one of your favourite games companies and asked which character you prefer in Luigi's Mansion 3. (That kind of thing happens all the time to us mere mortals, right?)
This story begins when Brie Larson – she of Captain Marvel and Room fame – responded to a Nintendo of America tweet about Luigi's latest adventure on Switch.
