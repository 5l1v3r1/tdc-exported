Blizzard Entertainment President J. Allen Brack on Friday apologized for his company's punishing a star Hong Kong video game player named "Blitzchung" for remarks he made in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. 
"You know, Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone esports moment about a month ago and we did not," Allen said at Blizzcon, the online gaming company's big annual convention in Anaheim, California. "We moved too quickly in our decision making and then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you."
"When I think about what I'm most unhappy about, there's really two things: The first one is we didn't live up to the high standards that we really set for ourselves," he continued. "The second is we failed in our purpose. And for that, I am sorry and I accept accountability."
