Ciaramella had a temporary position in the West Wing that ended in June 2017, dating from the Obama administration, and RealClearInvestigations published a report this week alleging he is the whistleblower whose complaint prompted impeachment proceedings against President Trump.
The whistleblower’s lawyers, however, have refused to confirm or deny the identity in the wake of the reports.
Andrew P. Bakaj, Esq. and Mark S. Zaid, Esq. said in a statement:
On his radio program on Friday, Rush Limbaugh cited the RealClearInvestigations piece that disclosed the name that reportedly has been circulating inside the Beltway for weeks and the revelation in the report that one of Ciaramella’s leaks led to the “Putin told Trump to fire former FBI director James Comey” rumor:
Despite the suggestions that the “whistleblower” is a partisan anti-Trumper, the Democrats are pushing ahead with their impeachment inquiry.
The Hill reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said on Friday that the investigation into Trump may expand beyond the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that contained the alleged “quid pro quo” the president sought from his counterpart.
Pelosi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, according to the Hill:
“But again, that will be part of the inquiry, to see where we go,” Pelosi said.
