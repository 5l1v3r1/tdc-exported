President Donald Trump has threatened to cut US funding to California for aid during wildfires that have burned across the state.
Neither of the two major fires burning in California are on forest land.
Mr Trump tweeted saying California governor Gavin Newsom has done a “terrible job of forest management”. He said the governor comes to the federal government for help every year when fires rage.
