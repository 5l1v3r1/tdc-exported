Ford wasn't kidding around when it said its new electric crossover would look like a Mustang. These spy photos of the new model, said to be called Mach E, clearly display several classic Mustang styling cuesâ€”although we're not sure how we feel about how they look applied to a vehicle like this.
There's a fair amount of Jaguar I-Pace in the Mach E's overall shape, as it's similarly long and low with smooth surfacing along the sides. But the slim headlights, familiarly shaped "grille" cutout, and three-bar taillights clearly identify it as a member of the Mustang family, at least in terms of looks.
Mechanically, it won't share anything at all with Ford's famed pony car, as it is slated to ride on Ford's new architecture engineered specifically for EVs. That will mean a floor-mounted battery pack said to provide 300 miles of range, and a likely setup of both front- and rear-mounted electric motors that will provide all-wheel-drive capability.
Ford will share lots more information about the Mach E when it formally debuts November 17. But in the meantime, you can sow your excitement (or discontent) by looking at these spy photos.
