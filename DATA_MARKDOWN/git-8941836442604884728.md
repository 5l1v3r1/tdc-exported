SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) - A Tennessee contractor is accused of raping a 70-year-old woman whose home he was repairing.
The Tennessean reports Santiago A. Garcia Cornejo is in custody on charges of rape and sexual battery. He’s being held on a $2 million bond and is set to appear in court Feb. 24.
An arrest affidavit says Cornejo was doing drywall work on the woman’s home in July when he said he needed to leave to get more supplies and returned intoxicated hours later. The woman told Spring Hill police that Cornejo then kissed and raped her.
Police say they had the woman call Cornejo days after the alleged attack and he conceded nothing. The affidavit says he was arrested the next day when he returned to work on the woman’s home.
