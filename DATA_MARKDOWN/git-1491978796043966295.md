Party denies misusing newspaper quotes and charts in election literature
The Liberal Democrats have defended themselves against accusations they are distributing “misleading and irresponsible” election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports as endorsements of the party.
In one leaflet delivered to households in London, a partial headline about the party’s success in a byelection in Wales is attributed to the Guardian when the original author of the words was its own leader, Jo Swinson.
The article attributed the quote to Swinson in the headline reporting that she had declared the party “on the up” after reducing Boris Johnson’s majority to one by snatching the Brecon and Radnorshire seat off the Conservatives in a vote in August.
