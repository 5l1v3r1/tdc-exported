        Saracens say they are “shocked and disappointed” in relation to the outcome of the independent disciplinary panel’s investigation into the alleged breaches of the salary cap.
      
Premiership Rugby this morning confirmed that Saracens failed to disclose payments to players in each of the seasons 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, in addition to having exceeded the ceiling for payments to senior players in each of the three seasons.
As a result, the club have been docked 35 points league points and also fined £5.3 million.
The club have confirmed they will appeal the decision.
