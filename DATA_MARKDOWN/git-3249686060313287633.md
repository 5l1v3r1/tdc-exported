CNBLUE's Yonghwa is now discharged from the army.
He was discharged from his army branch, where he greeted both fans and press. When asked which girl group gave him a lot of strength, he first said he got to know a lot of singers, but when asked to pick one, he chose TWICE.
Hopefully he'll come back to active promotions soon!
