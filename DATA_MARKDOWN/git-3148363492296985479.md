Wednesday’s episode saw Trump portrayed as an immoral figure advising Randy about how to get away with criminal activity. Giuliani also came in for particular opprobrium and was described as pulling a baggie of marijuana out of his anal cavity to give it to Randy, who’s in jail.
In the episode entitled “Season Finale” (though it is not the last episode of the season), Randy is arrested for tampering with marijuana and sabotaging the pot crop of a rival. He is eventually arrested and criticized for his increasingly obnoxious behavior.
To figure out how to get out of his troubles, Randy phones Donald Trump from prison and asks the president how to wriggle his way out of his crimes. Trump advises Randy to ignore his crimes and go on the attack against everyone else.
During the phone call, the show’s Trump impersonator asks Randy if he thoroughly denied all wrongdoing. When Randy said he had, the Trump character then advises, “Well, did you then go on the attack, and swap the accusations, to make yourself a victim?”
The Trump character then adds that Randy should try “Darvo.”
“DARVO,” the Trump voicer said. “Randy — deny, attack, reverse victim, and offender. Alright.”
