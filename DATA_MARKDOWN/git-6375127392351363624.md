Police identified the fatality, who suffered third-degree burns, as Renato Fidel Velasco.
Initial investigation showed that at around 11:39 a.m., the vctim’s relative, Zusima Velasco, and a  housemaid were in the dirty kitchen on the first floor when they noticed a cloud of smoke.  Upon checking, they saw the second floor on fire so they called the attention of Renato Velasco who was asleep in a room.
Personnel of the Bureau of Fire Protection, MDDRMO of this town and the Nasugbu municipal police station immediately responded to rescue the victims.
They found Velasco lying with burns all over his body so they rushed him to Jabez Medical Center but he was declared dead on arrival by the attending physician, Dra. Marivic Casiw.
Authorities are still investigating the cause of fire.
