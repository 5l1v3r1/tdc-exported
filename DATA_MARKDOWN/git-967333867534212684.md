        A pilot for the Chinese airline Air Guilin has been grounded after a photo of a woman wearing civilian clothes sitting in the airplane’s cockpit while it was airborne went viral on social media, drawing widespread backlash.
      
The photo was first posted by the unidentified woman on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website similar to Twitter. It was identified by a Chinese aviation blogger on Sunday. The woman is seen making the V-sign with her fingers in the photo. Some media reports have claimed that the woman in the photo is in a romantic relationship with the pilot, but this has not been confirmed. Chinese state outlet People’s Daily has attested that the woman is a student at the Guilin Tourism University and is in training to be a flight attendant.
