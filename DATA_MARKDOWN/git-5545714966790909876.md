Has there been enough of a gap that you could head back into Super Mario Odyssey and experience it with mostly fresh eyes? I think I'm about at that point. Some key moments in the game – a certain musical number, a world fueled by pure nostalgia, and a painful gauntlet – will have lost their original impact, but otherwise? The rest feels like a blur. I'm ready to play this precious adventure again.
If and when that time comes for you, it might be worth picking up The Art of Super Mario Odyssey to supplement your playthrough. Following its release in Japan last year, the English-language version of the book is finally out this week in North America courtesy of Dark Horse. I didn't end up importing it.
