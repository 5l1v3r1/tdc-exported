Dragon Age 4 was, for several years, one of the most open secrets in gaming. After the ending of Dragon Age: Inquisition's final DLC made it very clear that the saga of Thedas was far from over, we've been expecting another Dragon Age game to follow it. Despite BioWare constantly dodging any official confirmation that the fourth game is in the works, clues have long hinted that it was underway. Executive Producer Mark Darrah is a constant Twitter user fond of retweeting fan works and making cryptic statements to tease fans.Â 
At The Game Awards in December 2018, BioWare released a teaser trailer for what we can only assume is Dragon Age 4. Although there's precious little information to be learned from the brief video, we do know something is in the works, and more recent clues from Bioware have made us think an announcement could be imminent.
Here's everything we know about Dragon Age 4's existence, a possible release date, trailers, characters, and more.
