Jennifer Aniston has hinted at a mystery project that she and the rest of the Friends cast are apparently working on. She kept saying that “something is happening” in an attempt to avoid further grilling on what that may be.
The 50-year-old actor had been speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday evening, reported Daily Mail.
