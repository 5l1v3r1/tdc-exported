AEW World champion Chris. Jericho has challenged New Japan Pro Wrestling star Hiroshi Tanahashi to a match at Wrestle Kingdom 14. The challenge came on November 3 at Power Struggle in Osaka, following a tag team match pitting Tana and Kota Ibushi against Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi.
The lights went out and a video depicting someone beating down several men appeared on the big screen. When the camera panned back, it was Jericho in his Painmaker persona.
