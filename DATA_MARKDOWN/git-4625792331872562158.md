Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez encouraged toll jumping in the New York City metro system after anti-NYPD protesters swarmed a Brooklyn station and leaped over the turnstiles without paying subway fares.
“Ending mass incarceration means challenging a system that jails the poor to free the rich. Arresting people who can’t afford a $2.75 fare makes no one safer and destabilizes our community,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “New Yorkers know that, they’re not having it, and they’re standing up for each other."
