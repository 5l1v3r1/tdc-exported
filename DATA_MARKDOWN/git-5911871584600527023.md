Frank Ocean still hasn’t announced a new album, but we sure have been getting a lot of Frank Ocean songs lately. Two weeks ago, he released “DHL” and announced two new singles, “Dear April” and “Cayendo.” On Thursday, he debuted a collab with Skepta at the latest edition of his PrEP+ club night. And now he’s shared yet another new track called “In My Room.” Hear it below.
