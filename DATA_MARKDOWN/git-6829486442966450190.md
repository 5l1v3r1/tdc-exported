Victoria Police have confirmed that an image circulating around the internet of a police officer wearing an ‘EAD hippy’ sticker (“eat a dick hippy”) at a climate change protest is legitimate.
The photograph of the currently unidentified officer was taken at a demonstration against an international mining conference being held at Melbourne’s Convention Centre. In the picture, the action button of the officer’s bodycam is obscured by the sticker.
