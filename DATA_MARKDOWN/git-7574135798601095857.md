Advance Base (aka Owen Ashworth, who used to go by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone) has been covering Lucinda Williams‘ 1992 song “Sweet Old World” on tour this year, and following requests from fans for Owen to record it, he did just that. His version is still recognizable as “Sweet Old World,” but he really turns it into something that sounds like it could’ve been an Advance Base original. Owen says:
A stream of the cover premieres below.
Advance Base also has some upcoming shows, including two in NYC. He’s opening the 11/21 show of Stephen Merritt‘s Symphony Space residency, which is sold out, and he’s also playing Brooklyn’s Owl Music Parlor on 11/22 with Brittain Ashford (tickets). All dates are listed below.
