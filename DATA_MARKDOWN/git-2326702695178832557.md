It may sound crazy, but despite Dark Souls being 8 years and having received a lot of attention from the modding community, there has been one major obstacle that has proven to be a huge challenge for them. Put simply, it has been (so far) impossible for people to create custom maps and locations within the game.
Well, that’s not strictly true. While new areas can be created, a weird conflict with collision detection has meant that your character can’t really do anything with them. Well, except either fall or walk through them.
Following the release of a new video, however, it seems that (finally) this major hurdle may have been overcome!
