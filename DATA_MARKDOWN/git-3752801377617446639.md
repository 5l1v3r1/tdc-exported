"You're putting the cart before the horse," Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said in response to a question from a journalist in Parliament about whether he intended to sue the Sunday World newspaper.
The newspaper ran a story on Sunday quoting Mantashe, saying that he bribed two of their journalists to bury a story about his sex life. On Tuesday he released a statement denying this.
It's been a week of allegations of sex, bribes and denial by Mantashe. This week on The Story, we take you inside the allegations.
