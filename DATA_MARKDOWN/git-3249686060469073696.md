Choi Yeseul has slammed a media outlet for using her and newlywed husband G.O's likeness without permission.
The Youtuber uploaded a post on her Instagram, calling out the malicious behavior. The article uses a picture of Choi Ye Seul and G.O with a headline that reads "The Youtuber with 1 million subscribers who cheated and led the family in chaos." Choi Ye Seul then stated in the comments: "This is really too much. Please don't use our likeness without permission."
Netizens have been supporting the newlywed couple, stating: 

        "You must feel terrible. How could they use a picture of a newlywed couple for a headline like that?"
      

        "They need to be sued."
      

        "There are no sane people in Korea anymore."
      
What do you think of this situation?
