Over the past few days, you may have stumbled across rumours and speculation suggesting that Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic Games is either working on a new Banjo-Kazooie title, or that it has been acquired by Microsoft. Neither of these things are true.
The rumours appear to have started soon after it was revealed that former Rare artist Ed Bryan had joined Playtonic. Amazingly, a large part of the speculation was centred around one of Bryan's tweets, in which he shared a photo of a Microsoft bag.
