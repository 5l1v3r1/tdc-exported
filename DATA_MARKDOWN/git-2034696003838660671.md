Dr. Dre is going to be honoured by the Grammys for his trailblazing production work.
The Recording Academy announced on Friday (November 1) that it will salute the six-time Grammy-winning producer at the 13th annual Producers & Engineers Wing. Taking place on January 22, 2020, the event will kick off Grammy Week ahead of the 62nd annual Grammy Awards on January 26.
Deborah Dugan, President/CEO of the Recording Academy, called Dre “an influential force in music.”
“Dre breaks boundaries and inspires music creators across every genre,” she said. “His evolution as a producer solidifies him as a leader of the pack within our industry, and we watch in amazement as he continues to shape the future of music.”
