KOLKATA: It might have taken Virat Kohli just three seconds to say "yes" to day-night Test, but, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly feels, it could well be the first step towards a change that will bring the crowd back to the longest version of the game.
There has been a perception that it was Team India's reluctance in playing which has delayed the launch of day-night Test in the country.
Ganguly, however, did not find this reluctance when he proposed the idea to Kohli. "I don't know what happened in the past, but Virat was quite willing to go with it," Ganguly said at the launch of former umpire Simon Taufel's book here on Saturday. "Life has changed, so has the society. We need to try some changes too."
Taufel too agreed that adaptability is the way forward and getting used to the conditions in day-night Test is just that. "Sometimes you need to try out different things," the respected umpire said. "They may not always work, but you won't know that till you try," Taufel said.
