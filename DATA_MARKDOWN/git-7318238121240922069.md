Facebook introduced a new brand Monday: FACEBOOK.
The company announced in a blog post that the new brand, which retains the name of the social network, would have a new logo to better indicate all the various products and services it now offers, including Instagram and WhatsApp.
"Today, we're updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook," Antonio Lucio, the company's chief marketing officer, wrote in the blog post. "We're introducing a new company logo and further distinguishing the Facebook company from the Facebook app, which will keep its own branding."
The timing of the move is notable because the company faces calls from politicians and consumer advocates for the government to break it up into various pieces.
