Around these parts, I’ve become an expert on Mountain Dew products. I’m not sure how this happened and some days I regret my new career, but whatever. There’s a new flavour of Game Fuel to drink and review for you fine folks. This new flavour is called Charged Orange Storm and it is being released alongside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (The New One.) Is it good? Well, here’s a better question: Do you like orange soda?
This new flavour of Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel, also known as Game Fuel because that name is too long, is a promotional flavour and has Call of Duty branding all over it. Even the can is covered in camo patterns. And each can comes with a code that will earn you double XP in the newly released Modern Warfare.
Editor's Note: Unfortunately, this flavour doesn't appear to be available in Australia.
Reading that code was a pain in the arse. It is printed below the strange tab on the top of the can. But the text is small and actually seeing the letters on the shiny aluminium surface is tricky. I found it helps to angle the can towards a light source.
Enough about cans and codes and Call of Duty. How does this new flavour of Game Fuel actually taste? Let’s just say, Kel would love it.
