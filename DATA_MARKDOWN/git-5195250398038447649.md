With the unveiling of its premium hatchback Altroz slated for next month, Tata Motors is planning to give a facelift to its entire line-up by in 2020. In the same breath, the Tata Tiago was recently spotted with heavy disguise and a fair bit of tweaks as against the current model.
The production-ready model comes with a host of changes in the front fascia. A fleeting glimpse of the car suggests that major design cues have been derived from the soon-to-be-launched Altroz premium hatchback. The car will come with a new headlight. The lower part will get horizontal slats while the upper part is a meshed grille.
On the side, the car inherits the same silhouette. However, a little chrome treatment is expected in the new car that will be present around the handlebars and ORVMs. And also new will be the alloy wheel set up.
