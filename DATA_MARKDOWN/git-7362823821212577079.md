Forest officials in Arizona were mystified in October when local landmark Wizard Rock, a 1-ton boulder, suddenly vanished from its position along Highway 89 in Prescott.
Now they’re equally stumped by the boulder’s mysterious return on Friday. But they’re also pleased.

“We are thrilled the Wizard Rock was returned, and are grateful that whoever took it was conscientious enough to give it back to the public,” Sarah Clawson, a ranger for Prescott National Forest's Bradshaw Ranger District, wrote in a statement, according to the Arizona Republic.
A forest employee made the happy discovery, FOX 10 of Phoenix reported.
