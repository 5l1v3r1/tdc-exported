With the 2019 Rugby World Cup Final taking place on Saturday November 2nd, thousands of breakfast parties are expected to happen around the nation as England face South Africa at 9am.
Morrisons is opening its cafés early to sell St George’s bread rolls that cost only 50p each.
 
The 10-inch baps are being sold in store alongside giant packs of the ‘The Best’ pork sausages (£3) and 500g of back bacon (16 rashers) for £2.50.
But that's not all. The supermarket has also reduced its Big Daddy Breakfast from £6 to a fiver, meaning you can enjoy a massive full English breakfast at a great price before the game kicks off tomorrow.
You'll even get a free cup of tea with your morning feast if you are wearing the colours of the England flag.
If you need some booze as you cheer for England, Morrisons' award-winning The Best English Sparkling Brut Vintage 2010 is reduced in stores from £25 to £20.
The supermarket has also slashed the price of its own-brand DOCG Prosecco , which is reduced from £10 to £8, and two packs of ten Guinness cans are priced at £16.
