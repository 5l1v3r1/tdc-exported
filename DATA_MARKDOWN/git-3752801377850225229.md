Supporters decked in green and gold gathered at the Union Buildings, looking over Meintjieskop in Pretoria, from early on Thursday morning to send the Springboks off on their Webb Ellis trophy tour, which will be criss-crossing the country.
While President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed South Africaâ€™s national rugby team, showering them with praise, Springbok captain Siya Kolisi took his place next to the president.

The small contingent that had gathered looked up at the scene from below the Union Building gardens at the Guard of Honour, hoping Kolisi would turn and wave at them.
They cheered and chanted, calling for their favourite players, going wild if a Bok happened to give them attention.
