SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Nov 5) moved a parliamentary motion calling for Workers' Party (WP) MPs Sylvia Lim and Low Thia Khiang to recuse themselves from financial matters at Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC). 

        Here is his English speech in full: 
      
Mr Speaker, I beg to move that this Parliament affirms the vital importance of Members of Parliament maintaining high standards of integrity and accountability; notes the judgment in Aljunied-Hougang Town Council & anor v Lim Swee Lian Sylvia and ors and anor suit [2019] SGHC 241, where, amongst other things, the court held that:
Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang had acted dishonestly and in breach of their fiduciary duties, and their conduct lacked integrity and candour; and Ms Lim and Mr Low were fully aware that their conduct was of questionable legality.
