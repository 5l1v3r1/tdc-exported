A lawyer for the whistleblower who raised alarms about US President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine has said his client is willing to answer written questions submitted by House Republicans.
The surprise offer, made to Devin Nunes – the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee – would allow Republicans to ask questions of the whistleblower without having to go through the committee’s chairman, Adam Schiff.
Mark Zaid tweeted that the whistleblower would answer questions directly from Republican members “in writing, under oath & penalty of perjury”, part of a bid to stem escalating efforts by Mr Trump and his Republican allies to unmask the person’s identity. He said only queries seeking the person’s identity will not be answered.
