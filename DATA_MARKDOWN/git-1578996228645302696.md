Kim Kardashian debuted her own solo Elle Woods costume yesterday, which was impressive. But Kardashian outdid herself with her family costume: She dressed up with her children North, Saint, and Chicago as characters from The Flintstones. Kardashian first unveiled the four's look, then two bonus photos featuring Kardashian's husband Kanye West as Dino and baby Psalm as Bamm-Bamm.
