It creates an opportunity for a variety of students to come together, learn, grow their confidence and provide them a safe space for self-expression. For me it was an opportunity to show that we’re all the same and capable no matter our ability.”Free. Fri Nov 15 6.30pm. Ballroom at Dubai World Trade Centre, Dubai, www.dwtc.com
