KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” An ambush near the United States-Mexico border Tuesday morning claimed the lives of family members of a Kansas City, Kansas, attorney.
Denise LeBaron-Ramos, who has offices near downtown Kansas City, Kansas, released as statement Tuesday afternoon saying that her family members were among the three women, four children and two infants killed.
LeBaron-Ramos planned to make a statement to the media later Tuesday.
Nine members of a Mormon family were killed on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border, and authorities are investigating whether the attack was the result of mistaken identity.
The victims include three women, four small children and two infants, family member Alex LeBaron said from Mexico. All nine were dual US-Mexican citizens, he said.
The victims were "all shot while in vehicles while driving," LeBaron told CNN. Several children survived the attack.
