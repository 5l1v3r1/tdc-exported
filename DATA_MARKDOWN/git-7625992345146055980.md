What's in your wallet? Not enough cash, said angry Capital One customers after the bank suffered a widespread systems outage on Friday that prevented them from withdrawing money, blocked direct deposits and interfered with other transactions.
Capital One said on Twitter that it was experiencing a "technical issue impacting customer money movement, including direct deposits, and the ability for some customers to access accounts."
