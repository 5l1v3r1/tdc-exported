Marcus Watson has flown out to Japan to watch his brother Anthony play for England in the World Cup final on Saturday against South Africa after another successful social media campaign.
Following on from the success of the #GetBenToJapan campaign for Sale Sharks’ Ben Curry to go and watch his twin Tom, another hashtag #WatsonToWorldCup built momentum for Wasps’ Watson and he will now also be in Yokohama.
The Olympic sevens silver medalist took to Twitter to thank both Wasps and Dai Young for letting him go as it will mean he will miss his club’s Gallagher Premiership visit from Bath on Saturday.
