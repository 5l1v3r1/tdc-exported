NZXT has announced its first lineup of audio products for gamers. The full suite includes the AER wired headset with Hi-Res certification, STND headset platform for sleek storage, and MXER audio control station. All are designed with the clean aesthetic NZXT fans love and expect.
One thing I do love is that the design matches up closely with their range of PC cases and even their high-end motherboards!
AER is a comfortable, lightweight gaming headset available in open and closed-back designs which pairs with STND and MXER for automatic audio switching between the headset and external speakers
The audio ecosystem will integrate with CAM upon launch, allowing users to fine-tune their audio experience. Gamers will also be able to include NZXT audio products when creating a custom gaming PC with BLD, NZXT’s custom PC building service.
