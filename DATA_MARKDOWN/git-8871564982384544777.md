Is it possible that the hot weather of late in Bali are making people short-tempered? With several videos showing foreigners getting into fights having gone viral in the past few weeks, there may be reason to believe that alcohol and high temperatures do not make for peaceful nights on the island. 
One example of a recent fight was captured in a video shared by @punapibali on Instagram, showing a crowd of what appears to be foreign tourists getting into a drunken brawl in front of La Favela nightclub in Seminyak on Wednesday. 
At one point in the video, one man in a black shirt pushes a woman dressed in light purple from the sidewalk so hard that she falls into the street, before getting back up and throwing some punches at him.
Another ugly tourist brawl was captured on video a couple of weeks ago, right across from the same nightclub.
