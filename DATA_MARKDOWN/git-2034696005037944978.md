A pair of Michael Jackson’s sparkly socks are going under the hammer at auction, with experts anticipating that the lot will fetch up to $1 million, or £776,000.
The crystal-encrusted sparkly socks are being auctioned together with a signed letter from the late singer.
The socks were worn by the star the first time he performed his famous moonwalk dance during a performance of ‘Billie Jean’ in 1983. Jackson performed on 25 March, 1983 while recording the television special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.
As reported on GottaHaveRockandRoll.com, which is organising the sale, the socks are expected to fetch between $1-2m when the auction begins on November 13. They are described as being “in very good, stage worn condition” and come with a full “certificate of authenticity.”
