Two murder suspects, considered dangerous, escaped Sunday from a central California jail sparking a frantic manhunt, investigators said.
Santos Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, escaped from the Adult Detention Facility in the early morning, the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office announced.
Both men are five-feet-seven-inches tall, and they each have black hair and brown eyes, The Associated Press reported; Fonseca weighs 150 pounds and Salazar weighs 170 pounds.
