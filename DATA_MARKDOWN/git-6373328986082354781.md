        Donald Trump clearly doesn’t get a lot of support from sports fans after attending UFC 224 and getting booed relentlessly for the second time in a week. 
      
The sound of heckling crowds is common at sporting events, with enthusiastic attendees regularly dissing their opponents and yelling chants of support for their favoured participant. You know the sort – I’m sure a peppy cheer or derogatory football song popped into your head as soon as I mentioned it.
There’s usually a 50/50 split between support and opposition and the same appeared to be true at UFC 224. It was nothing to do with the fighters taking part, I might add, but rather for the President of the United States.
