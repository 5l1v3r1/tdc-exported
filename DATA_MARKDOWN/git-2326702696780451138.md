Rambus has announced that it has achieved industry-leading 18 Gbps performance with the Rambus GDDR6 Memory PHY. Running at the industry’s fastest data rate of 18 Gbps, the Rambus GDDR6 PHY IP delivers peak performance four-to-five times faster than current DDR4 solutions! It’s also 4 Gbps above that of memory used in the RTX 2080 Ti. Albeit, it’s not currently memory they’re deploying for consumer GPU products, but these things always take time to develop.
Increased data usage in applications such as AI, ML, data center, networking and automotive systems is driving a need for higher bandwidth memory. The coming introduction of high-bandwidth 5G networks will exacerbate this challenge. Working closely with their memory partners, the Rambus GDDR6 solution gives system designers more options in selecting the memory system that meets both their bandwidth and cost requirements. As any PC enthusiast knows, faster hardware is never a bad thing.
