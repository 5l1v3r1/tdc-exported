Earlier, we shared the news that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has now received its promised performance update on Nintendo Switch, taking the game from Version 1.02 to 1.03. The update has been long-awaited by fans who were left disappointed with the game upon release.
As such, we thought it best to also share with you this side-by-side comparison video so that you can see the changes for yourself. The video comes courtesy of Direct-Feed Games; after giving this a good once over ourselves, we'd say it's tricky to really notice any significant changes in the visuals department, but players are reporting much-improved load times and a decrease in input lag.
