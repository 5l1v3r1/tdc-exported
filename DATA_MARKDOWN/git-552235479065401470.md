Northern Ireland boss Michael O’Neill will be appointed as the next manager of relegation threatened Championship side Stoke City, according to a report.
It is stated the former Brechin boss will double his salary in the move, jumping from £750,000 a year to £1.5million.
He faces a tough task to turn around the fortunes of a club that has struggled chronically since they were relegated last season under Paul Lambert.
They sit bottom of the Championship with only two wins from 15 games.
 
O'Neill will be in attendance for the Potters' match against Barnsley on Saturday before taking charge of Northern Ireland's final two European Championship qualification group games against the Netherlands and Germany, according to the Athletic .
It is reported the matches will represent the final chapter in O'Neil's international management career and that Motherwell’s Stephen Robinson and Northern Ireland under-21 coach Ian Baraclough , ironically also a former boss of the Steelmen, are contenders to take over.
The news will be well received in Aberdeen after we revealed on Wednesday night Derek McInnes was also high on Stoke's shortlist for the job.
