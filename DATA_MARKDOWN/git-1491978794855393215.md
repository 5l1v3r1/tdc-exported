The ABC has announced that Hamish Macdonald will be the next host of Q&A, ending months of speculation over who would fill the role.
Macdonald will replace the founding presenter Tony Jones, who will step down from the position later this month after 12 years in the seat.
Macdonald will take over at Q&A from the start of the 2020 season in February, the ABC said at a 2020 TV program launch in Sydney on Thursday.
He will also become a regular member of the RN Breakfast on-air team, where he has been a regular fill-in host, and will be reporting internationally with Foreign Correspondent.
“I’m so passionate about telling the big stories of our time through Australian eyes, for an Australian audience,” Macdonald said. “I’m proud to join this great Australian institution and can’t wait to serve the audience by continuing the big and important conversations each week.”
