The left-wing Sunday Mirror exposed in 2016 that married Vaz had exploited male migrant prostitutes and that he had “jokingly” describing himself as a “pimp” in an audio recording.
At the time the scandal broke, the Labour MP, previously Minister for Europe in Tony Blair’s government, was a member of Parliament’s Home Affairs Select Committee and leading an investigation into illegal drugs.
He stepped down from the Home Affairs committee once his interactions with the prostitutes, which included references to abusing cocaine and “poppers”, were made public. But he was, within a matter of weeks, elected to the Justice Committee in a move Tory parliamentarian Andrew Bridgen branded at the time as an “utter disgrace”.
