Nardwuar stopped by Day N Vegas this past weekend, and while there, he did his first interview with one of the year’s most charismatic breakout rappers, Megan Thee Stallion. Like other first-timers, Megan was caught off guard by Nardwuar’s encyclopedic knowledge (“I love that song, how do you know these things?!” she asked, when he brought up Lil Ru‘s “The Nasty Song”), and the whole thing is very entertaining. Nardwuar also brought up Megan’s old principal, her first show ever (at the Dirty Dog Bar in Austin), and more, and he gifted her with a Pimp C t shirt, a Ladies of Gansgter Rap CD, and a Houston Rap Tapes book. Watch it all go down, below.
In other news, Megan landed her first fashion campaign, with Coach.
