The new Apple AirPods Pro came out last week, and Amazon has already given them a temporary price cut. They’re normally $250, but you can buy them right now for $235.
Currently, Amazon predicts that it won’t be able to ship your order for one to two weeks, but if saving a bit of money trumps getting them immediately, this deal is worth jumping on. Of course, if you discover them cheaper elsewhere before your order ships, you can simply cancel your order to make sure you aren’t charged.
My colleague Chris Welch reviewed the AirPods Pro, and according to him, they’re everything he wanted in a next-generation set of AirPods. They have better sound, noise cancellation, and thanks to the silicone ear tips, they’ll get a more snug, sound-isolating fit than the regular AirPods can manage.
It’s tough to imagine the price for AirPods Pro dropping any more than this for Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but we’ll be keeping an eye out for any and all deals.
