On November 2, Red Velvet's Yeri shared an intriguing series of Instagram Story posts, raising fans' anticipation!
In the Instagram Story series, Yeri can be seen listening to: "Story" by Ragoon (which Yeri took part in composing and writing); "Hair in the Air" by Yeri, Renjun, Jaemin, and Jeno; "Tuesday is Better Than Monday" by Giant Pink feat. Yeri; and finally, "Dear Diary" by Yeri. 
In one more following post, Yeri wrote, "What comes next?", above what seems to be a completed audio file, approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds. 
Do you think Yeri could be hinting at a new solo or collaboration release soon?
