STERLING, Va. — Joe Biden is working on a national campaign of his own, but he made time for a trip to Virginia to rally party activists two days before a pivotal state election.
On Sunday, the Democratic presidential hopeful and former vice president joined former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, local Democratic officeholders and party leaders on an outdoor stage in an office park in Sterling.
The Washington Post reports that Biden spoke of the importance of Virginia’s election as a predictor of the 2020 presidential contest. He said: “As Virginia goes, so goes the nation.”
Virginia Democrats are hoping to take majorities in the General Assembly. Republicans hold thin majorities of 51-48 in the House of Delegates and 20-19 in the Senate.
All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday.
