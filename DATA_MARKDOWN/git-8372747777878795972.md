PASCO COUNTY, Fla. -- Deputies have arrested two Port Richey residents after they say an unsupervised child fell off a 2nd-story balcony and they did not call for medical care.
It happened Friday evening at Wind Tree Apartments in Port Richey.
According to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report, a first floor neighbor heard thud outside and found a 14-month old child crying and limping. The neighbor looked up and saw a hole in the screen of a 2nd floor apartment and brought the child to the door.
The man who answered the door grabbed the child and closed the door. Fearing that the child needed medical attention, the neighbor called 911.
Investigators talked to a man and woman who live at the home where the child appeared to fall from, and were given inconsistent stories about what happened and what they saw.
Deputies arrested 24-year-old Cristina Jiminez-Gomez and 23-year-old David Gomez-Diaz. Both are charged with Child Neglect.
The child was flown to St. Joe's Hospital for treatment to internal injuries. There's no word on their condition.
