Suzuki V-Strom 1050 and the 1050 XT have been unveiled at the EICMA 2019. For the 2020 model, Suzuki V-Strom 1050 uses the same chassis, suspension units and engine as the predecessor, V-Strom 1000.
The V-Strom 1050 and V-Strom 1050 XT are likely to make their way to India too, by mid-2020 and we expect the prices to be between Rs 1.5-2 lakh dearer than the V-Strom 1000, closer to 15.5 lakh ballpark.
