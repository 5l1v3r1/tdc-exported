When President Trump arrived Saturday night at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York City, the crowd reaction was a bit more hospitable than the one he received at World Series Game 5 last Sunday in Washington.
Tara LaRosa, a mixed martial artsÂ fighter from New Jersey, tweeted video of a section of the Madison Square Garden crowd where the response seemed mostly favorably for the president.
