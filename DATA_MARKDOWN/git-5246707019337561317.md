Earlier this year, we shared the news that the folks over at SMBmovie.com had stumbled across new information and never-before-seen deleted scenes for the infamous 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie. We saw our first deleted scene back in August, but now we've been treated to something arguably much more important.
This new clip clears up one of the film's biggest mysteries, where a very obvious continuity error saw the random appearance of a giant puddle of slime. The issue was that this slime played a pretty major part in the scene, with Koopa slipping in the puddle as the Mario Brothers catch him off guard.
Now, we can see that the slime comes from one of Koopa's technicians. Koopa catches him sneezing and decides to have him de-evolve into a Goomba, but things don't go according to plan. The new scene starts at around the 1:25 mark in the video below, but you can also hear more about what we just discussed by viewing from the start.
