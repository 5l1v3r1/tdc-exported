Shirley Ballas has said it has been an “emotional” week after having her breast implants removed, and that she was in pain while filming Strictly Come Dancing at the weekend.
The TV judge took part in Saturday’s live show just four days after going under the knife.
She said she decided to go back to work right away because she had made a commitment to the programme.
Ballas, 59, told ITV’s Lorraine that, while she is in pain – and was during the live broadcast at the weekend – she is doing well, adding: “It’s definitely been an emotional week for sure.”
