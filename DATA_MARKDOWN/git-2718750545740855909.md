During Kristen Stewart’s SNL hosting debut, she gave it all she had — up to and including an enthusiastic F-bomb dropped during her monologue. Since her Gisele impression and Totino’s Pizza Roll romance on SNL in 2017, she’s been revisiting different sorts of icons in movies like Seberg, JT Leroy, Lizzie, and the anticipated Charlie’s Angels reboot. Nonetheless, for her return to Studio 8H, the writers didn’t lean on her film catalogue — nary a Twilight reference in sight! — instead using her presence as an opportunity to play with a bunch of new ideas, even if those ideas didn’t always have Stewart as their central focus.

        As usual, this week’s sketches are presented here in order from best to worst.
