HONOLULU (AP) - The U.S. Navy says it is considering a new plan to use double-wall tanks to upgrade a fuel storage facility in Honolulu.
Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday that the Navy updated its initial proposal to reinforce tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.
The Navy says if the upgrade cannot be completed it will relocate the fuel in the facility’s 20 tanks beneath the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer.
A 2014 leak of 27,000 gallons (102,203 liters) of fuel at the facility threatened Oahu’s drinking water and prompted calls for improvements.
The Navy’s Sept. 9 proposal had favored single-wall tank upgrades with added monitoring features.
The plan was rejected by a Honolulu City Council committee last month and was opposed by the Board of Water Supply.
