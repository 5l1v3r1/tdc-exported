Arsene Wenger says Aaron Ramsey wanted to stay at Arsenal and had an agreement to do so before the club "came back on that".
Wales international Ramsey left Arsenal for Juventus on a free when his contract expired at the end of last season.
Wenger had already left Arsenal at this point, and it was new boss Unai Emery who was in charge when the midfielder departed after nine years.
Ramsey wanted big money to remain at Arsenal, and Juventus were willing to pay up.
But despite this, Wenger is adamant Ramsey's heart was set on remaining in north London.
"Yep. In the end I met him once, he wanted to stay at Arsenal," said Wenger on beIN SPORTS.
"They had an agreement and the club came back on that, from what I understood. I tried a long time to extend his contract but sometimes you have influences of agents as well.
"Every case is different and you have to understand in decision makings always who is influential – or not – when you make transfers. What I know from him, he was keen to stay."
Ramsey has made eight appearances for Juventus this season, and has netted twice.
The Welshman was on target last time out for the Old Lady in a 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League.
