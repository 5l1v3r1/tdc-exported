South Africa have defeated England 32-12 to win the 2019 Rugby World Cup at the Yokohama International Stadium in Japan.
Tries by wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe and the goalkicking of Handre Pollard earned South Africa their third Rugby World Cup title on Saturday as the fly-half kicked 22 points to secure a 32-12 victory over an error-strewn England.
South Africa led 12-6 at half time through four Pollard penalties with Owen Farrell replying for an England team who had been overpowered in the scrum, having lost injured prop Kyle Sinckler after three minutes, and who committed a series of handling errors.
South Africa, playing with far more ambition than in their semi-final win over Wales, kept up the pressure in the second half as England struggled to build momentum and Pollard nudged them 18-12 ahead after an hour.
The Springboks then scored their first try in three World Cup finals when Mapimpi broke clear in the 66th minute, chipped ahead and collected the ball back from Lukhanyo Am, and recalled winger Kolbe then blasted through to put the gloss on a deserved win.
