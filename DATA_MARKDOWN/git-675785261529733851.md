Shocking footage shows a man setting off fireworks as he runs down a busy London street.
The clip, taken from a bus, shows a man sprinting while holding the firework - which goes off repeatedly in his hand.
Four blasts are seen in the clip, taken in Tottenham High Road on Thursday night.
Pedestrians are seen looking on in horror as the man, wearing a blue hoodie, releases the fireworks.
Â 
There was a person walking several yards in front of him when the final blast was set off.
Police have confirmed they are investigating, and no arrests have been made.
A statement from the Met Police said: "Police were called at around 21:00hrs on Thursday, 31 October to reports of anti-social behaviour involving a group of people setting off fireworks on Tottenham High Road, N17.
