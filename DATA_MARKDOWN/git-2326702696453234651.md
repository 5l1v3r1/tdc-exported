If there is one thing that I think many gamers would agree on, it’s that there is a significant problem in the gaming industry. Well, ok, there are lots of problems. To get more specific, however, one of the biggest is that developers have been allowed (for far too long) to release garbage onto the market without ever being accountable for, you know, actually making sure the game works. Fortunately, however, Australia is somewhat more enlightened on that subject than many other countries and has recently turned its attention towards Bethesda’s Fallout 76.
In a ruling that will undoubtedly have many Australian gamers rejoicing, their Competition & Consumer Commission has just determined that some people will be legally entitled to get a refund on the game. Why? Well, because it’s so bloody awful!
