The beautifully-crafted Souls-like/Metroidvania action-platform game Blasphemous is receiving a Limited Run Games physical release for Switch. The title was originally published on the Switch eShop and multiple other digital platforms by Team17.
Two-week pre-orders for the standard and collectors versions open next week, on 15th November. The Collectors Edition will be priced at US$79.99.
In our review, we gave Blasphemous nine out of ten stars and said it was one of the most visually arresting and solidly enjoyable action titles currently available on Nintendo's hybrid device.
