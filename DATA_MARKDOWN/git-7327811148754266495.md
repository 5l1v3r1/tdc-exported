WOODBRIDGE, New Jersey (WABC) -- A man accused of faking a slip and fall at a New Jersey business in January was sentenced this week to probation, community service and ordered to pay restitution.
Court officials said 58-year-old Alexander Goldinsky, of Randolph, was sentenced on Nov. 4 to two years of probation and 14 hours of community service. In addition, the defendant paid restitution in the amount of $563.48 to an insurance company at the time of sentencing.
The sentence was imposed after Goldinsky pleaded guilty on Aug. 16 in accordance with a plea agreement reached to a third degree insurance fraud, admitting he filed a false insurance claim for injuries he said he sustained at a business located in Woodbridge Township.
