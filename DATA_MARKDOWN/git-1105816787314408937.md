Ahead of Kartarpur Corridor’s inauguration, Prime Minister Imran Khan waived off two requirements for the Sikh pilgrims traveling to Paksitan on the occasion of Baba Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary.
In a tweet, the premier said members of the Sikh community coming to Kartapur from India will not need a passport. “They will be able to travel with a valid identity card.”
