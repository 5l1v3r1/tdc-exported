        It’s not enough to break the drought but the rain has a singular smell, intoxicating in what it evokes
      
Every day this spring, in this part of Australia, has been a good day to hang washing. It’s been weeks of swirling winds and dry air, and always the droning, reliable sun – sucking the moisture out of everything.
But perpetual sunshine can feel relentless, oppressive even. Everything is washed out in its yellow glaze.
With this weather comes a sense of a buildup. In the buildup there is tension, and a longing for release. How long can we go without rain?
It happened on Sunday. Up to 90mm of rain fell over drought-stricken regional New South Wales. Figures from the Bureau of Meteorology showed Bourke, in the state’s north-west, received 94mm over two days, “making it the biggest single rainfall event in the area since 2012”.
That’s a massive, game-changing and hugely joyful amount of rain.
Across NSW farmers posted videos of dancing in the rain and jumping in the mud. “There’s so much water,” exclaimed an excited farm kid.
