CAPE CORAL, Fla. --- We're working to see if Cape Coral Police made an arrest in a robbery at Saratoga Lake Park.
Many viewers told us they saw the officers on scene and a helicopter flying overhead there late Sunday night.
Police say someone robbed teenagers in the park, and got away with a cell phone.
They told us they have a good idea who the robber is.
The park is located on SE 4th Terrace, just off Santa Barbara Boulevard.
