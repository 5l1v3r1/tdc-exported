Senate majority leader and Elgeiyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has pledged his support to the judiciary, stating that he stands with the Chief Justice David Maraga.
This comes a few moments after the Chief Justice issued a public statement decrying frustrations from the Executive meted to the judiciary.
Murkomen through his Twitter account asked CJ Maraga to use his position and power as head of the Judiciary arm to fight back his tormentors without relenting.
“My message to the Chief Justice David Maraga, you have teeth, bite. “A tiger does not proclaim its tigritude before it strikes. You gave your tormentors an inch they want a mile. Lead,” Murkomen tweeted.
