Lacson said he already took this proposal up with Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, who both are already considering the suggestion.
Lacson confirmed that there is nothing irregular so far in the House-approved General Appropriations Bill.
He said the only changes he saw there are the P9.5-billion institutional amendments that Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano announced before transmitting the bill to the Senate.
However, he also noticed that there are “unclear” items in the National Expenditure Program but these cannot be considered “pork” allocations worth P20 billion as these were vetted by executive departments themselves.
“Kung wala namang maraming issues at pwedeng patawarin yung P20 billion at pwede nang ipaubaya sa DBM kung paano mai-realign, ang pinakamagandang gawin, dahil sa nakita namin na P9.5 billion lang na institutional amendments, baka mas magandang gawin namin i-adopt nalang yung House version,” he said.
”Kapag ganun, nganga yung mga may hawak na amendments para sa bicam. Kasi siyempre wala nang bicam kapag in-adopt namin yung House version,” Lacson added.
Lacson said senators have to keep an eye during the bicameral conference committee deliberations on the budget, as this is where congressmen could make their individual amendments.
“Kung totoo man na may kanya-kanya silang hawak o naisumite na sa appropriate chairman nila yung listahan ng mga gustong proyekto ng mga kongresista, malamang sa hindi, sa bicameral conference nila yun ilalatag o ipapasok,” he said.
“Yun ang delikado at yun ang kailangang bantayan ng Senado, at least yung magiging members ng bicam,” he added.
He also challenged congressmen to disclose to the public whether they would still make amendments to the budget during the bicameral conference committee.
“In the spirit of transparency, mas mainam na ipakita nila sa publiko, ia-announce na nila, ito yung aming mga individual amendments pa na hindi naisama doon sa third and final reading at nai-transmit na kopya sa Senado, para sa ganun maaral na rin namin para pagharap namin sa bicam, preparado kami,” he said.
