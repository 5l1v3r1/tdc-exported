Tawanrat Tippaveth “fainted” from shock when police took her into custody at a gas station in northeast Thailand this morning for her alleged role in massive graft by her daughter, accused scammer “Mama Manee.”
The 47-year-old Udon Thani resident started crying upon seeing an arrest warrant with her name on it and fainted when police tried to put her into their vehicle. Several police officers had to carry Tawanrat, who was transported to an emergency room for a medical check-up.
Before fainting, Tawanrat told police that her daughter, self-proclaimed net idol Wanthanee “Dear” Tippaveth, had asked her to open a bank account for unspecified business transactions. She said that she agreed without knowing what it was for. 
“She asked me to open a bank account to do her business, she didn’t tell me what. … I was suspicious about where she got the money, but I can’t talk to her about these things. … I have nothing to do with this,” Tawanrat told reporters through tears. 
After making brief comments, Tawanrat suddenly collapsed backward and had to be carried by a few officials to the police truck, surrounded by reporters all the way in true tabloid spectacle.
