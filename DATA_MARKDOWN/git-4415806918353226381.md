Springboks skipper Siya Kolisi has dedicated his team’s stunning World Cup final victory over England to the South African nation.
Kolisi, South Africa’s first black rugby captain, led from the front as the Springboks landed a third world title following victories in 1995 and 2007.
“Since I have been alive I have never seen South Africa like this,” he said.
“With all the challenges we have, the coach (Rassie Erasmus) said to us that we are not playing for ourselves any more, we are playing for the people back home, and that is what we wanted to do today.
“We appreciate all the support – people in the taverns, in the shebeens, farms, homeless people and people in the rural areas.
“Thank you so much, we appreciate the support. We love you South Africa and we can achieve anything if we work together as one.
“I honestly can’t explain how I was feeling, seeing the joy in my team-mates’ faces, as I know how hard they have worked and the coaches have worked.
“We had to believe in each other and believe in the plan. He (Erasmus) kept telling us how good we are and he drove us to places we have never been before.
