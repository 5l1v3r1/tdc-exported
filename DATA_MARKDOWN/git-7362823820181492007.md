Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce claimed former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., is not a victim, as the lawmaker herself suggested while resigning from Congress amid an ethics investigation into sexual impropriety.
During her final House speech last week, Hill claimed that she was the victim of a "double standard," which allegedly punished her but let "President Trump and others off the hook."
Bruce said Hill's own actions that are to blame.
"On the surface, it may appear that it's just one more politician who is having to leave because of their behavior. But a few things deserve to be cleared up," Bruce said in Fox Nation's latest episode of "Get Tammy Bruce."
Hill announced her resignation last week after pornographic photos of her surfaced online when a conservative news site -- RedState -- reported on an extramarital affair that Hill allegedly had with staffers.

Hill claimed that she was leaving the House as men remained in Congress, the Oval Office, and the Supreme Court after being "credibly accused of acts of sexual violence" -- a clear jab at Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
