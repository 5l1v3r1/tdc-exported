CINCINNATIÂ (AP) - An Ohio county commissioner has announced that his 27-year career in public office will come to an end by Dec. 31.
Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune said on Sept. 12 that he would not run for re-election because his cancer had returned.

It's not clear who will replace Portune.
