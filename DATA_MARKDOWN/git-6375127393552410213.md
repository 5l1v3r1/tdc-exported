The official said that members of the NCRPO-RMFB would return to their camps ready to respond to emergency calls 24/7.
Henceforth, members of the Quezon City Police District would be securing the MRT North Avenue to Santolan stations while the Eastern Police District will man the MRT Ortigas to Boni stations and the LRT Santolan station.
The Southern Police District will be helping secure the MRT Guadalupe to Buendia stations.
The Manila Police District on the other hand will help secure the LRT stations in their jurisdiction. The LRT and the MRT have their respective private security contractors securing their facilities.
Uniformed police officers assigned at the main entrances of the two facilities in the past have been instrumental in arresting MRT and LRT clients who tried to sneak in contraband including drugs and illegal weapons and explosives.
