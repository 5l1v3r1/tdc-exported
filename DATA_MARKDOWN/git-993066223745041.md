A senior Twitter executive has suggested a number of new features that could appear on the social network in 2020, including the ability to block being mentioned without permission.
The company’s vice president of design and research tweeted several ideas, although it is not clear whether they will become a reality next year.
Dantley Davis’s account teased that users could have the power to remove themselves from a conversation, as well as the means to disallow retweeting of certain posts if they do not want them being distributed by other people.
He opened a series of tweets, saying: “Features that I’m looking forward to in 2020,” listing removal of a specific mention from a conversation and tweeting only to a specific hashtag, interest or group of friends as potential options.
“Do you agree with the ideas in this list? What else would you add? #designtwitter,” he tweeted.
