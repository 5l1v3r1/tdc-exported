The National Emergency Operations Centre says it had more than 670 calls overnight, an increase on last Halloween.
The emergency calls came in between 7pm yesterday and 7am this morning.
In Dublin, the fire brigade dealt with 229 calls - 156 of them were Halloween related.
There were attacks on crews, including fireworks being used to intimidate staff, however no one was injured.
"There was an increase in calls from people who over-indulged in the Halloween festivities, there were trips and falls," said Richard Gleeson of the National Emergency Centre.
"There was more incidents relating to the Halloween festivities but we also had the normal calls - the medical and traumatic emergencies - that we would normally get as well."
Dublin Fire Brigade’s assistant chief officer, Greg O’Dwyer, has said that organised community activities have led to a reduction in the number of anti-social incidents on Halloween night.
Year-on-year there has been a “slight” decrease in the number of fire calls and ambulance related activities he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
