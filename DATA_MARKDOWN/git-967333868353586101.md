        James Dean, “one of the most epic film stars” in the American film industry, was cast in leading roles in three classic Hollywood films during his short life. Although the actor died in 1955 in a car crash in California at the age of 24, his portrayals remain highly regarded.
      
Two film producers, Anton Ernst and Tati Golykh, will use a CGI image of Dean in a new Vietnam War movie, after receiving a permission from the actor’s family. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film is an adaptation of the novel ‘Finding Jack’, written by Gareth Crocker.
The film revolves around the story of a soldier who bonds with Jack, a Labrador breed, during the Vietnam War, but was forced to abandon the dog together with ten thousand other military dogs when returning to the US.
