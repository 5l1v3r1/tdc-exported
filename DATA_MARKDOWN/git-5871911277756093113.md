Natalya and Lacey Evans have posted their feelings on social media concerning the historic match at WWE Crown Jewel. The match in question took place on Thursday, October 31 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and marked the first time that two female pro wrestlers have ever performed in that country.
This Crown Jewel event was met with heavy criticism from many fans around the world. The same was true of the other three events held in Saudi Arabia as well. But there’s no doubt that the bout between Natalya and Evans was indeed a very special moment for both women.
