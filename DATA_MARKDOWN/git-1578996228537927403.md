Did you even attend a wedding if you didn't Instagram how good you looked, specifically in a photo booth shoot complete with quirky props? We don't think so. But the situation can be challenging when searching for a grid-worthy option that can handle a winter forecast. The solution lies with dresses that play nice with tights, long sleeves in heavy fabrics, and jewel-toned velvets that look great against a snowy backdrop.
