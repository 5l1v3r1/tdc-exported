Owen Farrell's bumper deal that he signed in 2017 still makes him one of the highest-paid players in world rugby.
The England star is the face of the national team and also Saracens, who have won two out of the last three European Champions Cups.
As a result, he was able to sign a bumper contract to keep him at Sarries until 2022.
The deal is believed to be worth just over £750,000 every season, which totals £3.75m over the five years of the contract.
It means he is around the level of some of the top earners in the whole of rugby union.
At the end of 2018, Australia star Israel Folau was the highest-earning in the world with £1.2m in annual wages.
Despite his riches, Farrell enjoys a quiet life away from the pitch alongside his wife Georgie, who we married in the summer of 2018.
The pair have enjoyed a long-term relationship and finally tied the knot one year after he got down on one knee.
Farrell currently lives in a lavish Hertfordshire home alongside Georgie and their dog, Ron.
