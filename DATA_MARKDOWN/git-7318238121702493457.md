DES MOINES, Iowa — After months of hammering President Donald Trump in what he has called "a battle for the soul of America," former Vice President Joe Biden is now refocusing his campaign message at a critical point on a familiar theme: the middle class.
Ahead of a key test of his strength in Iowa this weekend at the state Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Dinner, which will feature 14 presidential hopefuls at the biggest gathering of party activists before next February's caucuses, Biden's campaign is launching a pair of new television and digital advertisements that play to his reputation as a champion of middle class values and working class voters.
The first ad, titled "Scranton Values," mixes old home videos of a much younger Biden in his original Pennsylvania hometown, as he talks about the values he said that community instilled in him.
