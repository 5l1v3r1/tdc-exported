Suranne Jones and Maya Jama have joined a literary project to shine a light on the lives of women.
They have recorded for an audiobook version of Gender Rebels: 50 Influential Cross-Dressers, Impersonators, Name-Changers, And Game-Changers.
Anneka Harry wrote the book, which outlines the lives of radical women from history who forged new roles and expectations for their gender.
Gentleman Jack star Jones has hailed the “courageous” figures in the book, and lends her voice to tell some of their stories.
Presenter Jama has urged young girls to listen to the inspirational chronicle of female achievement.
She said: “I believe that young women can succeed, no matter where they started from.
“But girls need to believe in themselves and what they can achieve, which is why I want everyone to listen to Gender Rebels and learn about the people who grabbed life by the balls, girls who hustled, broke the rules, and smashed it.”
