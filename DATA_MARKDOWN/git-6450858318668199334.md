Adobe has announced Photoshop Camera, an AI-powered smartphone app designed to help you take and edit photos on the go. Adobe said itâ€™ll be available for Android and iOS some time in 2020.
The app uses AI to let you edit pictures within the viewfinder before you take a shot, or post-shot like Photoshop users are used to. It appears that it will auto-generate editing suggestions based on what it detects is in the photo and what the shooting conditions are.
You can currently register to apply for early access to the app. The below video shows some examples of what the app will be able to do:
