The official noted that such hoaxes affected the attitude of the US public, thus damaging bilateral relations.
The New York Times reported earlier this week that 200 Russian "fighters" had allegedly arrived in Libya over the past six weeks as "part of a broad campaign by the Kremlin to reassert its influence across the Middle East and Africa".
The conflict in Libya started with mass protests during the "Arab spring", and resulted in NATO bombings of the government forces.Since the overthrow and assassination of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the country has been engulfed in a civil war.
At the moment, Libya is torn between two governments, with the eastern part controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the western part governed by the Government of National Accord (GNA).
