NASA’s Commercial Crew Development programme hit a key milestone today following a mostly successful abort test of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner, in which the module reached 650 miles per hour (1,046 km/h) in just 5 seconds.
The pad abort test of an uncrewed CST-100 Starliner happened at 7:15 am local time (2:15 pm GMT) today from Launch Complex 32 on White Sands Missile Range in the US state of New Mexico. The jettisoned spacecraft reached a height of 4,500 feet, followed by the deployment of two of its three parachutes and a safe landing on the desert floor. Boeing will now carefully inspect the crew module and review all the data, but the “initial indication is that we’ve had a successful test,” said a Boeing spokesperson during the live webcast.
