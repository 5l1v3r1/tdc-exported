Cuba Gooding Jr has pleaded not guilty to an indictment that includes allegations from a new accuser in his New York City sexual misconduct case.
Prosecutors at Thursday's hearing said they have also heard from several more women who could give evidence about their claims against the 51-year-old actor.
Gooding's criminal case now includes allegations from three women, growing in recent weeks from a lone allegation that led to his arrest in June.
Details of the new allegations were not immediately available.
Gooding's lawyers argued the indictment and accompanying paperwork do not specify any wrongdoing in that alleged counter.
Gooding has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.
