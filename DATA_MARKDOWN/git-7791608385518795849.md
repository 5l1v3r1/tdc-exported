Twitter had many riled up due to a recent bug on its iOS app. Users had complained that the timeline they were looking at would randomly scroll up and down on its own. The social network was quick to point out the faulty app, and announced via the Twitter Support account that it has fixed the iOS issue. “Thanks for your patience while we worked on this,” it wrote. It also urged iOS users to update their Twitter app to version 8.1.5 to avoid facing the auto-scrolling error ever again. Finally, users can enjoy their digital tidbits without any interruption. Many users were relieved at the news; even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who shared the sentiment in a tweet.
