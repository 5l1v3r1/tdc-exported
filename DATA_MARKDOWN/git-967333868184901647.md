        The whistleblower's complaints about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president into launching a certain investigation essentially led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry against the US head of state.
      
Appealing to the whistleblower directly, which appears to be a deviation from the norms of conduct in such matters, Trump claimed that the person should reveal themselves because they "got it so wrong."
Voicing his grievances via Twitter, as usual, the US president also claimed that the "Fake News Media", which he also described as "an arm of the Democrat Party", is well aware of the whistleblowers identity but is reluctant to reveal it "because there would be hell to pay."
