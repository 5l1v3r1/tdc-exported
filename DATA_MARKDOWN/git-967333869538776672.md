Crenshaw said the Republican party, which currently has only one black person in the House and one black person in the Senate, needs new messengers to reach non-white voters and to expand the party's electorate.
The Houston representative said that the conversation around attracting voters should concern Democrats as well, who shouldn’t take support from non-white communities for granted.
