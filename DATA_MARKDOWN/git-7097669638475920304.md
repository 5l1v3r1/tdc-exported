MILWAUKEE – A 61-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an acid attack on Milwaukee's south side Friday night that police are investigating as a hate crime.
Mahud Villalaz, 42, suffered second-degree burns to his face after a man he described as being white and in his 50s or 60s berated him and threw acid at him. 
In security video first obtained by WISN-TV, the two men are seen talking in front of a restaurant when the suspect points at Villalaz and then tosses the acid at his face. 
Villalaz can be seen stumbling away from the man, who then slowly walks toward Villalaz.
A GoFundMe page has been established to help pay for Villalaz's medical bills and lost wages while he recovers and gets additional medical treatment. Villalaz is a welder and has blurred vision in his left eye stemming from the attack.
As of Monday morning, more than $17,000 had been raised, surpassing a $15,000 goal.
On the GoFundMe page, his sister Priscilla Villalaz thanked police for making the arrest and thanked well-wishers who reached out to them.
