For the first time in days, even over a week, Bitcoin (BTC) has started to show signs of a short-term trend forming. As of the time of writing this article, the leading cryptocurrency is at $9,400, up some 2% in the past 24 hours. Earlier today, the BTC price reached as high as $9,550 on some exchanges, surging as bears have struggled to keep bulls under control.
Despite this, an analyst has shown that there is a confluence of signs showing that the crypto market is likely to see a slight pullback in the coming days.
Analyst Data Dater recently drew attention to a few signs that imply BTC will soon take a breather, which will be a move that will see the cryptocurrency head back into the $8,000s. He noted that indicators are “approaching overbought” on the four-hour, six-hour, and 12-hour charts, while the one-day chart and the two-hour chart are already flashing overbought signals.
