The ever-honest Joanna Gaines is keeping it real as she serves up details on her forthcoming cookbook.
On Thursday, the former “Fixer Upper” star announced that her “Magnolia Table Vol. 2” is officially available for preorder, and teased some of the recipes it will include when it hits shelves in April 2020.
Following the original “Magnolia Table” tome, which was published 2018, fans of the superstar designer can look forward to her delicious takes on mushroom-gruyére quiche, chicken-pecan-asparagus casserole, zucchini-squash strata and Magnolia Press chocolate cake, among others in the text’s 145 recipes.

“What made this second experience so unique was that most of my family’s tried-and-true recipes were already shared in the first cookbook, which required us to get in the kitchen, start from scratch, and develop a whole new collection of recipes for gathering family and friends around the table,” Gaines wrote on her Magnolia blog. “I hope this second edition gives you even more reason to gather with the ones you love!”
The HGTV star got even more candid in a YouTube video released Nov. 7, showing off her culinary chops as she stirred greens in a pan, mixed mashed potatoes and iced miniature chocolate cakes.
