After announcing that development on Payday 2 would be starting up again, Starbreeze and Overkill have unveiled their new plans for the co-op FPS, which includes a free update, Silk Road, and three DLCs. 
With the Silk Road update, all players will get access to a new cosmetic system that lets you choose both the mask and outfit for their bank robber, and to start you off you'll get access to six outfits for free. 
The tactical BDU, raincoat, scrubs, winter camo parka outfits and more will all be free, while a further 20 will be available via the Tailor Pack 1 DLC. Technically, you actually get fewer unique outfits than with the free update, numbering at only four, but each comes in five different colours.

For more practical criminals, there's also the Cartel Optics Mod Pack DLC, which nets players ten new weapon mods themed around optics and sights. You'll get three sights, two pistol sights, two optics gadgets, a grip, a muzzle brake and a compensator.
