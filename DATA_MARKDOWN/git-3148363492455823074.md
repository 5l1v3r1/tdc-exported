Reinhard Schramm, chairman of the Jewish community in Erfurt, has claimed that antisemitic attitudes have been pushed from the fringes of society into the mainstream, Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio reports.
“My feeling is that antisemitism has spread from the outside and moved into the middle of society,” Mr Schramm said. He went on to claim that the success of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) was “fertilising the ground” for extremism.
The study, published in Süddeutsche Zeitung, which revealed the extent of German antisemitic attitudes was released last week by the Jewish World Congress and surveyed 1,300 Germans.
The study found that around 41 per cent of respondents said Jews talk too much about the Holocaust, while 27 per cent overall hold some sort of antisemitic views.
