DiCaprio posted Friday to his Instagram account two photos of him and Thunberg posing on what appears to be a sunny hillside dotted with flowers and colorful greenery.
“It was an honor to spend time with Greta,” the Titanic actor wrote. “She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.”
Thunberg was in Los Angeles to attend a student demonstration for climate change. She also appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which tapes in nearby Burbank.
