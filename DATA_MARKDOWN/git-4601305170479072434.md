Jayson Gonzalez has learned that if you buy a donut from Krispy Kreme, you don't actually own it.
According to AP, Gonzalez is a 21-year-old accounting student in Minnesota, where there are no Krispy Kreme stores. He's been regularly driving 270 miles to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa to buy 100 boxes of donuts (a dozen in each box) at full retail price, loading them in his car, and delivering them to grateful Krispy Kreme lovers in Minnesota. His customers pay between $17 and $20 per box (they usually go for $8 to $12 a box). But when The St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote an article about the enterprising donut reseller, the corporate bigwigs at Krispy Kreme found out and they are now trying to put a stop to it.
