Joker director Todd Phillips has confirmed that a deleted scene from the film would’ve confirmed Sophie Dumond’s fate.
The mystery eventually had to be solved by those involved with the film in interviews after its release.
The mystery in question revolves around the finale of the film, in which Arthur Fleck finds himself in an asylum, with fans wondering whether the preceding events had actually happened, or it was all a figment of Fleck’s imagination.
The scene where the Joker leaves romantic interest Sophie’s apartment to be greeted by police sirens was a particular point of discussion, with fans wondering whether he’d killed her, or it was just another thing he made up in his mind.
