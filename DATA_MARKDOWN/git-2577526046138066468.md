After a few months, Payday 2 developer Starbreeze is about to drop the game’s first DLC in almost a year. Payday 2: Silk Road is set to arrive tomorrow, but a trailer released yesterday offers an insight into the upcoming series of heists, and more information is due later today.
The border Crossing Heist initially seems pretty tame by Payday standards, focusing on what looks like a biker bar out in the desert. It doesn’t take long, however, before you realise that the ne'er do wells hanging out there are packing more heat than you might initially have expected. An actual attack helicopter shows up during your heist, and as well as making off with the contents of the safe, the trailer suggests you’ll be trying to steal a private jet.
