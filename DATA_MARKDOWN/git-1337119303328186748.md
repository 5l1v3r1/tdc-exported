I finally got around to watching Widows, the latest film from Steve McQueen. I love McQueen as a director — I have distinct memories of feeling completely gutted walking out of Shame — and Widows is kind of a weird one for him. It’s really the first clear genre piece he’s taken on.
The film is based on a longer television series, and it very much feels like a condensed adaptation. There are a lot of characters and a lot of plot lines weaving in and out of each other. It’s the kind of thing that a book or a TV series can do really well, devoting as much time as necessary to each story. For a movie, it’s often better to simplify.
There are some lovely moments in the movie, though. The intro deftly weaves through the film’s deep cast of characters, offering telling moments with each of them. And the climactic moments remain tense and personal, while still hitting those fun heist-movie beats.
Check out nine trailers from this week below.
