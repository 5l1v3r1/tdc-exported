        Call of Duty: Modern Warfare already feels like a pretty feature complete game, but new Modern Warfare DLC could massively improve the map count.
      
Despite already including an impressive 19 multiplayer maps across all of its modes, developer Infinity Ward could be adding a lot more.
A dataminer has discovered that Modern Warfare lists a whopping 38 extra maps within the game’s files. Not only is this amazing news for fans of the shooter, but for fans of the sub series as a whole as classic maps make a return.
If the datanine is leading us to real maps, you’ll be able to 1v1 on Rust once again. Also included in the list are Crash, Shipment and Sub Base.
The full list is as follows:
In a separate datamine, a CoD fan site discovered that Modern Warfare DLC will also include the return of some awesome modes.
Demolition, Gun Game, Infected and Capture the Flag are all accounted for. (Please bring gun game back!)
The full list of modes is as follows:
That’s a lot of Call of Duty.
