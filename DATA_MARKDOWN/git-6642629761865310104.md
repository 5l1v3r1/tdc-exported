Nigel Farage has unveiled 600 Brexit Party candidates for Britain's general election and warned the governing Conservatives that the United Kingdom will never leave the European Union without his party's backing.
All seats in the 650-seat House of Commons are up for grabs in the December 12 election. Farage says his party will run in every constituency in England, Scotland and Wales unless Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson scraps his EU divorce deal.
Farage's party, which was founded earlier this year, rejects Johnson's Brexit deal, preferring to leave the bloc with no agreement on future relations in what it calls a "clean-break" Brexit.
Farage said Monday that Johnson's deal "is not Brexit. It is a sell-out."
Farage says the Conservatives are arrogant for not joining him in a "leave alliance".Â
