Shoppers in Glasgow were among the first to taste a new festive flavour of Irn-Bru.
The limited edition Crimbo Juice is a spicier version of the original, with added ginger, clove and cinnamon.
Drag queens Frankie, 24 Carat Goldie and Myriam helped launch the new spiced ginger flavour, handing out bottles from a giant snow globe on Buchanan Street.
The famous orange and blue packaging has been changed to red and blue with a snowflake for the seasonal offering.
Mary Mac, aka 24 Carat Goldie, said: “Us Scots can’t get enough of the ginger stuff and it’s utterly fabulous helping to launch Irn-Bru Crimbo Juice.
“Spiced ginger is a real Christmas cracker.”
