Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admits he is hurt by seeing his side in the bottom half of the Premier League.
A terrible start to the campaign, amid a backdrop of dressing-room unrest and misfiring players, has seen Spurs win just three of their opening 10 games.
They are closer to the relegation zone than they are the top four going into Sunday’s visit to Everton, which has taken on extra significance.
Spurs have not been this low in the table since the first few weeks of Pochettino’s reign and the Argentinian is not enjoying looking at the standings.
