Skepta and AJ Tracey have released a video for their anticipated collaboration ‘Kiss And Tell’.
The duo dropped the song – which Skepta produced – and its video on Halloween, a week after teasing it on social media. “The real AJ Tracey fans know this is a special one for me,” Tracey said of the collaboration on Twitter.
Following the track was its grainy, homemade music video that the two rappers appear to have shot in a hotel together. It also features live footage from Skepta’s Ignorance Is Bliss tour, on which Tracey serves as a supporting act. Watch the ‘Kiss And Tell’ video here:
