Topline: A former quality control engineer at Boeing has claims that up to 25% of oxygen systems on the 787 Dreamliner aircraft could be faulty, according to the BBC.
Key background: The world’s biggest plane maker has come under intense scrutiny following two fatal crashes in five months involving its 737MAX model, which has been grounded since March. The aviation giant, already on its back foot, faces additional pressure with new claims about safety issues with the flagship 787 Dreamliner and negative publicity around structural issues with older models of the 737NG aircraft.
Tangent: The Guardian reports that Ryanair has grounded three 737NG planes after cracks were discovered on the pickle fork—the part of the aircraft that strengthens the connection of the wing to the body of the plane. Ryanair follows Southwest Airlines, Qantas, Gol Linhas Aereas and Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air in grounding 737NG aircraft that were discovered to have the same structural flaw.
