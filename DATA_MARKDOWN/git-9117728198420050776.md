        Aston Martin Red Bull Racing team advisor Helmut Marko has said that he has got no plans to retire just yet. The 76-year-old still flies all around the world with the team and he has no intention of this stopping anytime soon.
      
"As long as I can perform this work mentally, I can continue to do so," Marko told Motorsport-total. com.
 “I don't understand why some people are so upset that they have to fly a lot. The majority of people crave such adventures and I fly with a certain degree of comfort."
 Marko spent two years as a driver in Formula One, making ten race entries, first appearing at the German Grand Prix in 1971.
 On the whole, it has been a positive season for Aston Martin Red Bull Racing with Max Verstappen currently fifth in the drivers' standings and Alex Albon eighth.
