        Part of the joy in seeing the latest would-be Satoshi Nakamoto revealed as a fraud, is in 
        watching their so-called ‘evidence’ being pulled apart and proven false by experts. Bitcoin Podcaster, Kenn Bosak, however chose a different tack.
      
The Faketoshi in question is Jörg Molt, a German man who clearly isn’t Satoshi, but we’ll get to that later.
Presenter of the ‘Not Another Bitcoin’ podcast, Kenn Bosak, tweeted a video of himself outing Molt at the World Crypto Conference in Las Vegas last week.
