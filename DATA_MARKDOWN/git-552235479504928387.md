Celtic fans could vastly outnumber Lazio for Thursday's Europa League clash, as the Italian club reveals slow ticket sales.
The competition is not one which particularly captures the imagination in Italy, with Lazio averaging just 16,000 fans last season, compared to around 37,000 in Serie A.
The Stadio Olimpico has a capacity of over 70,000 and Celtic supporters could well be the majority for the match.
Marketing director Marco Canigiani said on Lazio Style Radio : "A bus service will be available for Lazio-Celtic, but it's directly proportional to the demand from the fans for this match.
"For the game on Thursday we've sold over 14,000 tickets but the majority of that number has gone to Celtic. We expect a growth in sales of those available to Biancocelesti fans.
"Thursday will be an important match in terms of qualification, the team will need support for it.
"The prices are also very reasonable for Thursday's match, hopefully we can be in the majority at the Stadio Olimpico considering there will be around 9,000 fans from Scotland in the away end."
The Curva Nord where Lazio's Irriducibili ultras sit will be closed for the game, after fans gave fascist salutes in the last home game against Rennes.
