Publisher Graffiti Games has released a new video for arcade-style shooter Bite the Bullet, which is bringing its retro-flavoured action to PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch next year, courtesy of indie developer Mega Cat Studios.Described as a "Run & Gun & Eat" adventure, Bite the Bullet features multi-platform, 8-way shooter action similar to titles such as Contra and Metal Slug, (I also get a strange Midnight Resistance vibe from its industrial aesthetic). As players blast their way through each stage, taking down waves of enemies and devouring their remains, weapons and abilities will unlock based upon your diet. The enemies you choose to feast upon will alter your character's build, stats and effectiveness in battle, essentially making your menu your skill tree.
