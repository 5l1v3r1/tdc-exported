As the metaphorical sun continues to shine on the mighty Springboks and the team's millions of adoring fans across the republic, Tuesday will not quite measure up to be Faf Speedo weather for most provinces, but should nonetheless prove to be finer than an English summer.

        Warnings
      
A high fire danger is expected over the interior of the Northern Cape, western parts of the Free State and North West, Central and Little Karoo of the Western Cape, and northern parts of the Eastern Cape, says the SA Weather Service.

        Watches
      
Severe thunderstorms are expected over the western parts and midlands of KwaZulu-Natal by the afternoon.
Special weather advisories 
Strong interior winds (62 to 72km/h) are expected over the Karoo Hoogland Municipality of the Northern Cape as well as the Central Karoo, Breede Valley and Langeberg in the Western Cape on Wednesday.

        The weather in your region
