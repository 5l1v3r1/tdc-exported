Self-exiled Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has said he will return to the country on Saturday to face arrest after a mass crackdown at home on opposition activists and the detention of members of his banned party by Malaysian authorities.
The government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has accused members of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) of plotting a coup and said they will be arrested if they try to enter the country. 
"I will depart from Paris on Thursday November 7. I will arrive in Bangkok on Friday November 8 to be ready to enter Cambodia on Saturday November 9," Sam Rainsy, the CNRP's founder, tweeted on Wednesday along with a photo of his aeroplane ticket.
November 9 is Cambodia's Independence Day, celebrating freedom from French colonial rule.
