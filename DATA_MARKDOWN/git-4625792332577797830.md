President Trump criticized Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s attorney, for his 2017 tweets calling for the president to be impeached.
Zaid sent several tweets in 2017 calling for a “rebellion” and a “coup” against Trump, hoping it would lead to an impeachment.
During his rally in Louisiana on Wednesday night, Trump bashed Zaid as a “sleazeball.”
“It’s all a hoax,” said Trump. “It’s a scam. And you know who helps them? These people right back here, the media.”
Trump pointed to Zaid’s tweet claiming that CNN could “play a key role” in his impeachment.
