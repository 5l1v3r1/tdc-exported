Voyager 2, the spacecraft launched toward the outskirts of our Solar System decades ago, is still very much alive and kicking, and recently sent home the first message from interstellar space, NASA's researcher Ed Stone told USA Today.
The data details the ‘cosmic shoreline’, or Heliopause, where the sun’s influence ends and interstellar space – often described as the space between stars – officially begins. NASA research on Voyager data, published as five separate studies in the journal Nature Astronomy, shows that the spacecraft has left the sun's bubble of magnetic fields and particles, far beyond the Oort Cloud.
The scientists point out that the boundary of the Solar System is surprisingly precise.
Voyager’s longevity came as a surprise to NASA scientists.
Voyager 2 was launched on 20 August 1977, 16 days before Voyager 1. For decades it has travelled toward the distant planets of our Solar System, sending back numerous images and allowing for numerous astronomical discoveries.
