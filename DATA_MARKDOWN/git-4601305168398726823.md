In Indianapolis, a confused deer crashed through a glass window into a suburban school, sending teachers and students into security lockdown mode.
Hinkle Creek Elementary School Principal Jack Lawrence told a reporter the deer smashed through a window Monday afternoon and entered the Noblesville schoolâ€™s main hallway.
Students and staff at Hinkle Creek Elementary School in Noblesville are all okay. The windows were shattered. No word on the deer.
