        Max Verstappen revealed after the US Grand Prix that there was some significant floor damage to his car. This impacted that Aston Martin Red Bull Racing car and meant that the Dutch driver couldn't perform as well as he hoped.  
      
“Overall we had a really good race,” Verstappen was quoted by RaceFans.net. “I was just struggling with some weird oversteer in the car.

        “Initially I thought it was [that] they said it was my front wing which had a little bit of damage. But after the race, I looked at the car and I was missing a big piece of my floor in front of the rear tyre so that definitely cost me a lot of lap time today.
      

        “I don’t know when it happened, but already quite quickly into the race I had this weird behavior from the car which I had not felt before. So that’s a bit unfortunate, otherwise, I think we could have been stronger today.
      

        “But still to be on the podium here after a very positive weekend, in general, I think there was a really great achievement for us.”
      
Verstappen performed well but will be annoyed as he could have passed Lewis Hamilton if he didn't have the damage.
