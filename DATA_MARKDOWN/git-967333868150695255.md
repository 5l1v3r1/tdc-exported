This Halloween, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg sparked reactions by posting a black-and-white photograph of herself with her trademark school strike placard.
While stressing that she did not celebrate Halloween in Sweden, she thought that she “might give it a try” this year. The school strike movement figurehead claimed she scared “a bunch of angry climate crisis deniers” as she were, without even having to dress up, hence her usual look.
