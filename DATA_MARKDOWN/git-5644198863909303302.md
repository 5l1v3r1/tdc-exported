REUTERS: London Stock Exchange Group Plc said on Wednesday its shareholders would vote on Nov. 26 on whether to approve its US$27 billion deal to buy data provider Refinitiv.
The LSE agreed to buy the financial information provider in August, in a deal aimed at offering trading across regions and currencies.
The deal was announced 10 months after a Blackstone-led consortium completed a leveraged buyout of Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters , the parent organization of Reuters News.
