Odell Beckham hasn’t even played a full season for the Browns, but he’s already being discussed as a possible trade candidate.
With Cleveland off to a disappointing 2-6 start in Beckham’s first season since the blockbuster trade from New York, there’s been talk that the Browns might try to trade OBJ. According to Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman, some teams believe that if the Browns continue to struggle this year and into next year, trading Beckham could be a realistic scenario.
