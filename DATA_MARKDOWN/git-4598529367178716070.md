Gordon Sondland — the ambassador who has already had to amend his impeachment testimony once — was accused of fabricating a separate episode in his testimony Wednesday by another witness in the Ukraine inquiry.
A lawyer for former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill said on Twitter that Sondland had “fabricated” the details of an encounter with Hill he described in his closed-door October deposition. The transcript of the deposition was released Tuesday.
