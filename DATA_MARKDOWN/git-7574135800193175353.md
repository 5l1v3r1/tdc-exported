French Touch artist SebastiAn’s new album Thirst comes out this Friday via Ed Banger/Because Music, and one of its most anticipated collaborations — the song with Syd from The Internet — has now been released. Syd gives an airy, ethereal performance, and SebastiAn matches it with an atmospheric backdrop. Listen below.
SebastiAn has a few December tour dates, including an NYC show at Webster Hall on December 21.
