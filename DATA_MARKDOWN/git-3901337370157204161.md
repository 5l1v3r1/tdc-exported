During his early days as a professional footballer, Orlando Pirates star Thembinkosi Lorch produced a bit of magic that is still remembered as one of his finest bits of skill yet. Check it out!
The skill move in question is the one he completed during his early days with Maluti FET College, when he shibobo'd Bidvest Wits star Thabang Monare, who was playing for Jomo Cosmos at the time, before sending him away with a filthy rakhatha.
Since then, the pair have done well for themselves, and have endeared themselves to the Orlando Pirates and Wits faithful as two of the club's crowd favourites.
