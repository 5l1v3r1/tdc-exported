        Anyone who has resting b*tch face might be in trouble – China is now using emotion recognition to predict and identify criminal behaviour. 
      
Imagine if you’d had a bad day at work, or a passing driver splashed you with a puddle and you just couldn’t contain your anger. Getting labelled as suspicious by the government after that certainly wouldn’t be the cherry on top of your day.
China often appears to be ahead of the game however, and apparently they do consider emotion recognition to be a valid way to predict criminal activity.
The news comes from Financial Times correspondent Sue-Lin Wong, who recently attended China’s largest surveillance tech expo, held once every two years in Shenzhen.

        In a thread on Twitter, Wong spoke about the new system the country is rolling out, writing:
      
Emotion recognition systems work by identifying signs of aggressiveness and nervousness, as well as stress levels and a person’s potential to attack others.
