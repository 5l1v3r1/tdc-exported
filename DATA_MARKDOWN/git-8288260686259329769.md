Many Christmas traditions have stood the test of time - roasting chestnuts, hanging up a stocking and leaving a mince pie out for St Nick.
But for the modern festive fan - the latest staple of any successful December is a red coffee cup.
And in Birmingham the countdown is on for Starbucks to return with their limited edition Christmas beverages.
They will be in stores across the UK, from Tuesday, November 5.
While Starbucks keep their seasonal range secret until the launch, these old favourites are rumoured to be making a return.
 
On the yuletide list are Gingerbread and Eggnog Lattes, as well as a Toffee Nut option.
And this year will also see two types of hot chocolate on offer, including Salted Caramel Brownie  and - as a new addition for 2019 - Toasted Marshmallow flavour.
 
Those who fancy something a little colder, however, can pick from a range of Crimbo-themed iced drinks, like the Salted Caramel Brownie, Gingerbread Coffee and Gingerbread Cream Frappuccino.
Each store will also have a range of limited-edition reusable cups, each with a wintry theme, to help you do your bit for the enviroment.
