Kimbrough, the president of Dillard University, a historically black university in New Orleans, Louisiana, came under fire this week after he said that historically black colleges succeed because they exclude racists from their student body and faculty.
“I think now many black high school students are experiencing more overt racism, so they are looking for places where race is not a day to day issue to be navigated,” Kimbrough said in a comment to The College Fix. “At an HBCU, students can just be students and not worry about the politics of race.”
“I think many have worked to be more inclusive, but those schools still enroll students who don’t have the same value of diversity and inclusion,” Kimbrough added. “A university may do everything right but they will still enroll racist students, faculty and staff who will make the climate uncomfortable for black students.”
Despite this, Kimbrough has received praise for his willingness to defend free expression on college campuses. A column published by Forbes in October juxtaposed Kimbraugh’s protection of free expression principles against that of institutions like Middlebury College, which infamously allowed its students to derail an event featuring Charles Murray.
