        New Delhi (Sputnik): Abhishek Bachchan, son of Indian megastar Amitabh Bachchan, has not been seen on the silver screen for quite some time now, with 2018 being the last time he appeared on the big screen.
      
Indian actor Abhishek Bachchan has shared a motivational post on Twitter that read "Have a purpose, have a goal. Something impossible you want to accomplish, then prove to the world that it's not impossible" - and it immediately led to a sarcastic comment from a user, who wrote: “What do you call a person who is happy on a Monday? Unemployed!”
The netizen was apparently referring to the fact that the 43-old actor and son of Bollywood A-lister Amitabh Bachchan, has not appeared on the silver screen for a long time.
