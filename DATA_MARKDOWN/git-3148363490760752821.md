Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, announced the prototype centrifuge, adding Tehran is now spinning 60 centrifuges of less advanced design — twice as many as the nuclear deal allowed. 
Fox News reported Iran is getting close to a one-year “breakout” period to producing enough weapons-grade material to build an atomic bomb, a significant threshold because only the most drastic measures could prevent the Iranians from taking the final steps at that point.
“In the four years since agreeing to the nuke deal, which was brokered by the Obama administration, Iran has already flaunted its disregard of stockpile and enrichment limitations, all the while hinting to European countries that increased economic aid and additional sanctions relief could persuade leaders to agree to a new deal or come back into compliance with the current one,” Fox News noted.
Salehi teased additional nuclear deal violations to illustrate Iran’s “capacity and determination.” The European Union responded on Monday by warning that while it remains “committed” to the nuclear deal, its commitment may weaken if the Iranians persist in escalating their violations.
“We have continued to urge Iran to reverse such steps without delay and to refrain from other measures that would undermine the nuclear deal,” said Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for top E.U. diplomat Federica Mogherini.
Germany, which has been strongly supportive of the deal, on Monday called Iran’s latest moves “unacceptable” and warned that Tehran is “doing nothing less than putting the entire nuclear agreement at risk.”
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, did not immediately comment on Iran’s latest provocations.
Iranian state media on Monday reported over a thousand government-sponsored rallies to commemorate the takeover of the U.S. embassy 40 years ago. Participants in the rallies chanted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” while Iranian officials instructed them to see the hostage crisis as a demonstration of defiance against Western “bullying.”
