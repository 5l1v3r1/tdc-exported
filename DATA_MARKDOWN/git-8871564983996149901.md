Singer Leah Navarro was declared persona non grata by the General Santos City Council after she tweeted that the earthquakes that recently hit the town and other parts of Mindanao were nature’s way of getting back at them for supporting President Rodrigo Duterte.
Navarro’s tweet appeared after former Supreme Court spokesman Theodore Te asked on his Twitter account on Thursday,  “What’s with all the earthquakes in Mindanao?” Navarro replied by asking, “Retribution?”, angering netizens.
Navarro is a vocal critic of Duterte, the only Philippine president from Mindanao, where his hometown of Davao City is located. Three years into his term, he remains a divisive figure, in part because he remain unapologetic about his bloody drug war, which has killed thousands of Filipinos.
Te ended up deleting his question, and apologized for an unintended offense in another tweet on Saturday, describing the question as “rhetorical, non-political, and personal.”
“To family and friends from Mindanao, please be assured of my prayers for your safety,” Te added.
