Dutch authorities swarmed Amsterdam's largest airport on Wednesday likely fearing the worst, only to discover that a jet's warning trigger had been pressed accidentally.
Air Europa confirmed via Twitter, after all crew and passengers had been evacuated from the Madrid-bound flight at Schiphol airport, that an alarm had been activated "by mistake."
