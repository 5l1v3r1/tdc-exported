Before Bridesmaids, Spy, and an attempt at rebooting Ghostbusters, writer and director Paul Feig is in a meeting with a lawyer.
Feig should be working on the TV show he created, Freaks and Geeks, but it’s a tense time. The meeting is about to be interrupted by an up-and-coming producer: Judd Apatow.
“I was in a lawyer’s office because my mother died two days before and I was sorting that out,” Feig tells me — he’s in Australia to promote his new film Last Christmas.
“It was this very weird thing, Judd called me and he was so upset, and I was just so emotionally drained, and it was one of those moments where you’re like, of course, what else can the universe do to me right now?”
Freaks and Geeks was the right show at the wrong time. The authentic high school dramedy, inspired by Feig’s own experiences as a teenager, pre-dated what would become the norm on TV for the decades that followed with shows like Friday Night Lights, Stranger Things, Veronica Mars, Girls, Master of None and Love.
The low-fi approach to capturing teenage life stood in contrast with the popular glossy, fast-paced teen series from the 90s like Beverly Hills 90201 and Dawson’s Creek.
