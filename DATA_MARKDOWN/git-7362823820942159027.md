Shia LaBeouf will do anything to raise money for charity.
During a recent visit to "The Ellen DeGeneres" show, the talk show host challenged LaBeouf to eat a ghost pepper, known for being one of the spiciest foods on Earth.
"I want to give you $10,000 for a charity of your choice," DeGeneres, 61 said. "But I understand you like spicey things?"

LaBeouf confirmed that he enjoys spicy foods as the pepper was brought to him.
"There's water here, what else can we help you with if this pepper's really, really bad?" DeGeneres asked.
"That pepper's gone," LaBeouf said. "Say 'bye-bye pepper.' He's out of here. Bye-bye pepper."
Without hesitation, the actor, 33, chomped down on the pepper.
"That's a cute little pepper right there," LaBeouf said. "It's a cutie pie. It'll take a minute to kick in probably."
"Be careful, I don't want to throw up on your knee right there," LaBeouf joked, placing a tray in his lap just in case.
