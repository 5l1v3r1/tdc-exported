A London tenant was left unable to warm his house up after his landlord put the thermostat in a cage.
Alex Milsom shared a picture of the thermostat on Twitter, where it quickly went viral.
He told the PA news agency: “Hilariously/alarmingly this is a common experience as other people who have replied to my tweet have told me.
“We had the Nest installed earlier this month, and then sometime between Friday night and Saturday afternoon we found our Nest adopted the motto of MC Hammer – namely ‘can’t touch this’ – and lo-and-behold we had no ability to control the thermostat.
“This also affected our ability to control the hot water – and today and yesterday we found our hot water availability in short-supply.”
With the temperature getting increasingly frosty, Mr Milsom said he is unable to heat up extra water in the house, and ended up having to shower at work when the hot water ran out.
He added: “People across London, the UK, and indeed across the world have replied to my tweet to say about their experiences. From landlords who have taken away heating to landlords who have been even worse, it’s a really important discussion that I’m glad we had.
