“He is an oil President. His Cabinet is an oil Cabinet,” Fonda told the CNN Tonight host when he asked for her thoughts on the ongoing partisan impeachment proceedings against President Trump. “He is bought off by fossil fuels. And a lot of people in the Senate, a lot of Republican candidates, are too.”
“We can’t solve the problem when we have elected officials who are paid by the fossil fuel industry,” Fonda added. “And so the sooner that we move beyond him, the better, whether it’s through the elections or through impeachment or whatever.”
