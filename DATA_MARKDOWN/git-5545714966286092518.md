Do horrible things to your liver in today's contest to win a PC copy of Afterparty!
Oh, that pesky Satan. He's always doing stuff that's kinda evil, but also kinda tricky. It's like the scales are tipped against you when dealing with him. Quite frankly, I think it's rude. Stop that, Satan.
Give the Devil his due in Afterparty, where you challenge that big red idiot to a drinking contest to win your freedom from Hell. Pretty cool setup, right? We've got some PC copies to give away, so read more to find out how to win!
