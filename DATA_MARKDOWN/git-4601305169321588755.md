If you have any unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, and you have a loaf of bread and some peanut butter and jelly, you can now reduce or cover the cost of your tickets by making a PB&J sandwich.
Anchorage local NBC news affiliate KTUU-TV reports the university will take donations for their annual payment bartering tradition until November 8, to help combat student hunger.
