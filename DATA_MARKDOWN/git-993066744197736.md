Martin Bashir has survived the axe from X Factor: Celebrity, despite forgetting the words to his song.
Instead soap stars Victoria Ekanoye and Jonny Labey got the boot after losing out in the public vote.
Bashir stumbled while performing the Commodores song Easy during the live show and  said: “I’ve forgotten my words, I do apologise.”
