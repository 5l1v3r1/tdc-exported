For a limited time, you can get the Apple TV 4K for $90 through AT&T. That's an $89 savings, and you don't need to be an AT&T subscriber to take advantage of the sale. This is the lowest price we've seen yet, and you can thank the launch of Apple TV+ for the promotional deal.
Apple TV 4K has been around for a couple years, and it's still one of our favorite streaming devices. As you may remember, this was Apple's long-awaited entry into the 4K/HDR world, and the device delivers. 4K video looks stunning, and dark scenes look great thanks to HDR. The biggest potential downside is that support for surround sound tops out with Dolby 7.1, meaning it doesn't support Dolby Atmos.
Of course, you don't need an Apple device or Apple TV to watch the company's new streaming service. It's also available through the Apple TV app on Roku, two Amazon Fire TV Stick devices and Samsung smart TVs. It should arrive on more streaming devices and TVs soon.
