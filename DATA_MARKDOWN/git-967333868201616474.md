The company granted $1 billion in a loan fund for state construction projects aimed at low- and middle-income residents, another $1 billion was allocated for the first time buyers mortgage assistance fund, $300 for Apple-owned and available land for affordable housing, as well as $150 million for the Bay Area housing fund and $50 million to help the homeless.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has already welcomed this unprecedented undertaking.
