After neglecting Contra: Rogue Corps for some time, Konami last week rolled out its first free update for the game â€“ adding hardcore missions and new modes. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any quality of life changes or fixes for the Switch version.
Now, though, another patch has arrived. Yes, less than a week after the release of the first one, we've received another. This one is mostly comprised of gameplay fixes but also makes some changes to certain areas of the Switch version. Below are the full patch notes:
In the same information post over on the Contra: Rogue Corps website, Konami revealed another update (yes, a third update) would be released soon. This one is mostly gameplay fixes, but there's also improved control responsiveness in the game's single-player mode.

        Would you be willing to give this game a go now that Konami has rolled out a few updates for it? Tell us below.
