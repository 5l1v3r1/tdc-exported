The German president regretted that not all hopes of those past days had been fulfilled and that Germany and Russia had drifted apart.
Steinmeier concluded by saying that Germany remained forever grateful to Gorbachev. He recalled their latest meeting in Moscow two years ago and wished the former Soviet leader good health, optimism and prosperity.
This month marks 30 years since the fall of the Berlin wall, which split the German capital into the Eastern and Western parts. Next year, Germans will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the nation's reunification.
