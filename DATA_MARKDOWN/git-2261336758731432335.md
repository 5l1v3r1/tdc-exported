It was not a great fight by any means, but Canelo Alvarez (53-1-2, 36 KOs) is now a world champion at light heavyweight.
Moving up two divisions from his present middleweight (160 lbs), he engaged in a tactical, if a bit action-starved boxing match with Sergey Kovalev (33-4-1, 29 KOs) at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was closely contested through ten rounds, but Canelo turned up the heat in the 11th and started to land some big shots. A big right hand and left hook had the Russian on skates, and another right hand put Kovalev down and out cold against the ropes. Referee Russell Mora immediately stopped the right, and for obvious reason.
Canelo now has the WBO title at 175 lbs, taking the belt away in spectacular fashion in an otherwise unspectacular contest. Kovalev started 2019 having regained the WBO belt by avenging his loss to Eleider Alvarez, but after defending that belt against Anthony Yarde in August, his reign as champion ends in the most brutal knockout defeat of his career.
