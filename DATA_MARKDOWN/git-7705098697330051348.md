Disney+ launches in under two weeks, bringing several classic Disney films and TV shows plus a slew of original content. But now that the House of Mouse owns 20th Century Fox, we can expect to see some of that studio’s greatest hits there as well, including the second biggest film of all time. Disney+ has just confirmed that Avatar will be available to stream when the platform goes live on November 12.
The new streaming service made the announcement on Twitter with a new video featuring the film’s director, James Cameron. You can check out what he had to say below.
