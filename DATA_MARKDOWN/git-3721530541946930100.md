To celebrate the launch of the new Team Rocket Special Research in Pokémon Go, Shiny Meowth has finally been added to the game.
In addition to this, Ekans and Koffing will be spawning more, which means you can use this as a chance to grab one of their dope Shiny forms. Note that these two will not have their Shiny rates increased, though. More Pokémon that are Team Rocket-related will also be featured in raids, but specifics have yet to be announced. Cobalion will still be the featured Pokémon in tier-five raids. These spawns and raid changes will last until Nov. 14 at 4 p.m. ET.
Sandshrew, Bellsprout, Magnemite, Porygon, and Wobbuffet will also start appearing from Team Rocket PokéStops as Shadow Pokémon. If you don’t have Porygon-Z yet, this is a great chance to score some candy to help get one. Meowth, Scyther, and Sneasel are also disappearing from regular Team Rocket PokéStops and will only be featured in battles with Team Rocket leaders starting today.
