Rejoice PC gamers! For today marks the release of Red Dead Redemption 2 on our beloved platform! Well, at 1 pm (GMT) to be more specific!
Admittedly, the release has come a little earlier than most of us were expecting, but Iâ€™m not complaining. Well, aside from the fact that I still have around 20GB to go of the 110GB download. In terms of how well the game will run, however, Rockstar did make it pretty clear that this release would provide the option for those of you with truly high-end systems to get some pretty amazing levels of performance out of this release.
