Bosnian war survivors, including mothers who lost husbands and sons in the Srebrenica massacre, have protested in Sarajevo, urging the Nobel Committee to reverse its decision to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature to Austrian writer Peter Handke.
Protesters gathered outside the Swedish embassy in Sarajevo carrying banners with slogans comparing Handke with Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb war-time leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic .
All three former Serb leaders were tried for genocide before a U.N. tribunal handling war crimes from Bosniaâ€™s 1992-95 war.
Milosevic died in 2006 before the end of his trial, while Karadzic and Mladic were convicted and imprisoned for life.
