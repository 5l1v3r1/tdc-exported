COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) — Democrats will hold a City Council majority in Vice President Mike Pence’s Indiana hometown for the first time since the 1980s if a candidate’s one-vote victory margin holds up.
Unofficial results from Tuesday’s local election show Democrats winning a 4-3 Columbus City Council majority as they defeated two Republican incumbents. The (Columbus) Republic reports that Republican Councilman Dascal Bunch might seek a recount of the 260-259 tally favoring Democrat Jerone Wood.
Bartholomew County Democratic Party chairman Bob Hyatt says the council victories came from young candidates stepping up and wanting to make a difference.
Republican Mayor Jim Lienhoop was unopposed for reelection. He says city leaders have worked across party lines for a long time.
The county clerk says Democrats last won a City Council majority in the 1983 election.
