Samantha Ray Mears, who was 19 at the time of the attack, entered her ex’s home while he was out. When he returned, he found her armed with a machete.
The teen forced him to remove his clothes and get on the bed before removing her own pants, crawling on top of him and sexually assaulting him, by forcing him to engage in sexual intercourse.
