Fans of Ridley Scott’s 1980s sci-fi movie Blade Runner have branded November Blade Runner Month as it was pointed out the film is no longer set in the future.
The original film, starring Harrison Ford and Sean Young, was released in 1982 and set in Los Angeles in November 2019, meaning that the movie is no longer as futuristic as it looks.
A fan of the film tweeted out a short clip, commenting: “Blade Runner has officially become a movie set in modern day.”
