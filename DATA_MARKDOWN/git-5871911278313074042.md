The Fiend Bray Wyatt has commented on his Universal Championship win at WWE Crown Jewel. That win came on October 31 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in a return match from Hell in a Cell. It marked the second time the Universal title changed hands at Crown Jewel, with the first coming in 2018 when Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman.
The feud between Wyatt and Rollins has been going strong for several weeks, as The Fiend has done everything in his power to get in the head of The Beastslayer. Indeed, Brayâ€™s mind games have been at an all-time high, as he has attempted to mentally destroy Seth Rollins.
