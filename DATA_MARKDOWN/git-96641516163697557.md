While World of Warcraft Classic has been great for a lot of players, the modern version of the MMO is still going strong. At Blizzcon 2019, the team announced it's eighth expansion, Shadowlands, which will follow Battle for Azeroth. After characters die, and before they are revived, the world they see is the Shadowlands, and in this pack "Azeroth's heroes will confront the wonders and horrors of the afterlife."
