TUPELO, Miss. -- President Donald Trump lashed out Friday at Democrats in the House for their vote this week formalizing the impeachment inquiry into his conduct, calling it "an attack on democracy itself."
Democrats are "disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives," Trump charged during a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi in support of the state's Republican candidate for governor. "They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won," he told the packed crowd.
The rally came a day after Democrats voted to formalize the investigation into whether Trump abused his office and compromised national security when he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals. Aggrieved and feeding off the energy of the crowd, Trump repeatedly defended himself against what he called the "deranged impeachment witch hunt" and accused Democrats of doing anything to take him down and invalidate the results of the 2016 campaign.
