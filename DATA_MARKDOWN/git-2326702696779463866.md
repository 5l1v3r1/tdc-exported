If you’re in the market for a brand new monitor, then the AOC brand can surely not have escaped your attention. They are, by far and away, one of the biggest and most reputable brands out there. I myself actually own more than one of their products and are more than happy with their performance and particularly their highly competitive prices.
In announcing their latest design, however, the Q27T1 is definitely a pretty major step up in terms of both functionality and (perhaps more specifically) style!
AOC has officially revealed its brand new Q27T1 monitor which has been designed by Studio F. A. Porsche. Who are Studio F. A. Porsche? Well, despite their Austrian/German roots, they’re nothing to do with the car company. They are one of the world’s most premium and highly-rated design companies! One who lives and breathes ergonomics and aesthetics.
Put simply, if you want a product to have a top-level of style and sophistication, you let Studio F. A. Porsche take a look at it!
