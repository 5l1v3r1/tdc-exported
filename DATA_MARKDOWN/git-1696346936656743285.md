        Crypto exchanges are having a gruesome week, as a growing number of platforms face sudden closures, multi-million dollar hacks and fierce lawsuits. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of all the latest exchange action.
      
Last week saw several incidents related to crypto exchanges, further showing that even in 2019, trading crypto holds unforeseen risks.

Last week saw much more than the BitMex email leak, with several hair-raising events linked to exchanges big and small.
Last week saw several markets throw in the towel. Lowered altcoin volumes, more complex regulations, and a concentration of funds on larger markets precipitated the death of smaller markets.
DX.Exchange at least closed in an orderly manner, offering a period to withdraw funds. The reason for the closing were rising operational costs related to security and legal transparency. The crypto exchange is now seeking a partner to buy it out and salvage its business.
