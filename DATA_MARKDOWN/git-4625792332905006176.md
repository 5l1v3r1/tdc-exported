President Trump accused a top House Democrat of preparing to release "manipulated" transcripts of closed-door impeachment testimonies ahead of their expected release in the coming days.
Trump took aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who has faced controversy for his handling of the impeachment effort, and called on Republicans to release their own transcripts.
"If Shifty Adam Schiff, who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the 'call,' is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers & others that are & were interviewed, he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes," Trump said in a tweet Sunday evening.
The president suggested that Republicans "should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiff’s manipulated propaganda. House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty’s rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar, leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!"
