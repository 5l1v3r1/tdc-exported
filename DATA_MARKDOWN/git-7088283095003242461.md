        It is hoped the sale of a 52 percent stake in France's national lottery 'Francaise des Jeux' will bring in 2 billion euros for the French government. FDJ is the fourth-largest betting company in the world.
      
France's state-owned lottery 'La Française des Jeux' (FDJ) started its transition to the private sector on Thursday.
The state will retain a 20 percent stake in the company, and will benefit from a yearly public contribution of some €3.5 billion.
The indicative price for shares in the operator have been set between €16.50 and €19.90, which would value the company at up to €3.8 billion.
A third of the shares have been reserved for individual investors, who are being offered a two percent discount.
FDJ's scratchcards and lotteries are played by millions, and the sale could help jump-start the reform drive after it was knocked off track by the 'Yellow Vest" protest movement.
The privatisation is part of President Emmanuel Macron's broader reforms to re-vitalise the French economy and make it more welcoming for foreign investors.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that the sale was a "chance for the French to diversify their holdings at a time when interest rates are low."
