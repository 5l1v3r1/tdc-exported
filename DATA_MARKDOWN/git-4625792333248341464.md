A judge ordered President Trump to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged he used his former charity for personal and political benefit.
The lawsuit filed by the New York state attorney general's office in June 2018 alleged that Trump and his three eldest children — Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka, and Eric — improperly used the Trump Foundation to settle business disputes and help his presidential campaign.
The settlement comes nearly a year after Trump agreed to dissolve the charity and distribute the remaining assets to other charities under the supervision of the attorney general’s office.
Trump vowed last year that he would not settle the case.
