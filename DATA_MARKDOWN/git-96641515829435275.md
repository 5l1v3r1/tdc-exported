Red Dead Redemption 2 finally launched on PC this week, but much like the escapades of the game's gunslingers, things haven't quite gone according to plan. Players have reported a raft of problems, including issues with the launcher, freezing and recurring crashes.
The usual go-to fixes for these sort of hiccups -- updating graphics drivers and disabling anti-virus software, for example -- haven't done a whole bunch to remedy matters. As such, Rockstar announced a new update for its games launcher -- but that's not helped either, with scores of players taking to Twitter to complain that they're still unable to play the game, despite following Rockstar's troubleshooting guide to the letter.
