RAJKOT: Seems like the prayers of the cricket fans have been answered as bright sunshine was visible on Friday afternoon ahead of the second T20I between India and Bangladesh scheduled to be played at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in the evening.
It was speculated that Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) Maha would play spoilsport as heavy rains were predicted for Friday evening. However, statistician Mohandas Menon tweeted the images of the city soaking in bright sunshine.
