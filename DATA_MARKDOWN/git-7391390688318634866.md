Universal Studios Hollywood received an impromptu concert from a Grammy-winning musician over the weekend. On social media, Chrissy Teigen shared footage of a John Legend performance after he got wine drunk. Donned in a red onesie, Legend took to a CityWalk stage in Los Angeles on Friday, Nov. 1 to perform a drunken rendition of his 2013 ballad “All of Me.” In the clip, which appears to have originally been captured by journalist Yashar Ali, Teigen simply cannot contain her laughter as her husband performs a live version of the love ballad written specifically for her in front of a small crowd.
“John got wine drunk and sang a song at universal studios last night," Teigen captioned the Twitter clip on Saturday, Nov. 2. She later added in a follow-up tweet, “the whole joke was supposed to be that literally no one was watching or at the stage but then he got on stage and was like ITS ME JOHN LEGEND.”
In the impromptu performance, Legend changed up the lyrics with a self-love twist. He sings in the clip, “I give my all to me, I give my all to me. I’m my end and my beginning. Even when I lose I’m winning. ‘Cause I give me all of me.”
