It was also first predicted by the Siya crew that City were keen on bringing on board a Dutch tactician, this after they parted ways with Head Coach Benni McCarthy at midnight on Sunday.
While Muhsin Ertugral and Cavin Johnson were initially all linked to the vacant position, Siya sources thereafter revealed that club chairman, John Comitis was keen on bringing in someone with a Dutch philosophy of football.Â 
The club confirmed on their official Twitter account, "Another era of excellence begins. "I'm really proud to be back here, and I'm really proud to coach this team."
