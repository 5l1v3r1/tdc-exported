Singstar was one of the most important series ever released on a Sony console. And in January 2020, after 15 years of PlayStation karaoke, it’s finally going to be shuffled off the stage.
The first SingStar game was released on the PS2 in 2004, and it’s on the PlayStation 2 that the series really left its mark. Years before the Wii’s release, the SingStar series helped drive (along with other series like Buzz) an unprecedented growth in “mainstream” console adoption in PAL regions, as demographics that previously had no interest in playing Grand Theft Auto or Final Fantasy rushed to pick up a PS2 so they could play party games with their friends.
