A good musician knows how to give the people what they want — and how to tease what's coming. The internet is ablaze now that Harry Styles has officially announced his new album, Fine Line, which will arrive just in time to be the perfect holiday stocking stuffer. Not only did the artist confirm the title of his second solo album, he also announced the release date — Dec. 13 — in a tweet on Monday, Nov. 4, accompanied by an image that appears to be the album cover.
On the Fine Line album cover, Styles is shown rocking a pair of white pants and a hot pink blouse — unbuttoned midway, of course. But he's not alone in the photo. A mystery hand covered in a black glove is shown reaching out to him from behind the fishbowl camera lens. What does it all mean and how will all of this factor into his new list of songs? Those are questions that, unfortunately, have to go unanswered for the time being. However, just knowing that a new Styles album is on the horizon should be enough to kick your holiday spirit into overdrive and leave you wishing it was December already.
