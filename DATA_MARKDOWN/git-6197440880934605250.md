The Pixel 4’s camera is pretty outstanding, but its best feature by far is its ability to capture pictures of the stars. If you get the chance to take some astrophotography shots with your Pixel 4, here’s how to edit those pictures to make them look even better.
Taking astrophotography images on the Pixel 4 is already significantly easier than it would be from a traditional camera. In fact, I’d argue that the vast majority of the time, the Pixel will have better unedited results than a DSLR. However, with just a few tweaks, you can make these shots look even better than they did straight out of the camera app.
To get started, we’ll first need to capture some shots using the Pixel 4’s astrophotography mode. For that, you’ll need a clear night away from light pollution, a tripod — this one on Amazon includes a remote — and the Pixel’s Night Sight mode. Combine them all with a quick read of our tutorial on the topic, and within just a few minutes you’ll have a stunning result.
