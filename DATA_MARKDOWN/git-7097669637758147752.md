The New York Times published a lengthy analysis of President Donald Trump's tweets since taking office, and found several patterns of behavior.
More than anything, the president uses Twitter when he wants to go on the attack. Of the 11,390 tweets that The Times analyzed from January 20, 2017 to October 15, 2019, more than 5,000 were attacks against someone or something, from the Democrats to the Russia investigation.

The six reporters on the project also found that Trump likes to use Twitter to praise himself, which he did 2,026 times.
On July 11, 2019, for example, he called himself "so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!"
Threatening to "obliterate" Turkey's economy on October 7, 2019, he touted his "great and unmatched wisdom."
On July 3, 2018, Trump bragged: "If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!"
The analysis also shows that Trump's Twitter use has dramatically escalated in recent weeks, as the Democrats undertake the inquiry into his impeachment.
In the first two weeks of October, Trump tweeted more than 500 times, which put him on track to triple his monthly tweet average.
