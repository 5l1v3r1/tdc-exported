        Max Verstappen has been taking some criticism for his driving style from some of the drivers on the grid. Many believe that he is too aggressive but Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas have come to his defence. 
      
Lewis Hamilton was the biggest name to openly criticize the Red Bull driver but others on the grid think this was unfair. 
Ricciardo likes the way his former teammate drives. "I like Max and the way he races," he said to Sky Sports. "I'd rather race against someone like him than someone who isn't as interested in defending or attacking hard."
Bottas also believes that Verstappen is being wrongly attacked. "I think it's a bit exaggerated," he told SSN at the Formula 1 demonstration in Hollywood. “He has had very good races with great catch-up actions. Racing hard but fair. He's aggressive and that's great. Every driver behaves differently, but that's great because it would be boring if we were all the same."
Verstappen will hope to prove his critics wrong with a strong result at the United States Grand Prix this weekend.
