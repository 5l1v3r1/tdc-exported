Oh, imagine the internet content glory we almost had.
Lev Parnas and his associate David Correia were planning to produce a series of ‘Fraud Guarantee’ TV infomercials starring Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
We almost had to put up with even MORE of Rudy on cable news, report Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng at The Daily Beast:
Giuliani knew of the plan, reports The Daily Beast, and “had multiple discussions with the two men about possibly signing on as their national pitchman,” but sources say “it’s not clear whether any footage of those planned Fraud Guarantee infomercials was ever shot, or if any deal was ultimately officially inked.”
Also completely not clear what the point was on any of this, since they had no known customers. Wonder who they really served?
