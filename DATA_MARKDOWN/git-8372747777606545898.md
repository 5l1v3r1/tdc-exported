BOCA RATON, Fla. â€” Just like Lyft and Uber, there is a new ride-sharing service aimed at children.
The service is called 'Zum,' and its focus is children ages five and up.
While the service is not set up in southwest Florida, it is being tested out in Boca Raton.
the company says their goal is to provide personalized, door-to-door ride-sharing service for kids.
For parents, this may sound sketchy and possibly dangerous.
one driver says the company doesn't play around when it comes to safety; drivers go through several background checks.
