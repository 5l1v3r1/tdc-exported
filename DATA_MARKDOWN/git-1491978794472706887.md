        First minister and SNP leader to address pro-independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday
      
An independent Scotland is “within touching distance”, Nicola Sturgeon will tell a pro-independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday afternoon.
Her promise comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted that a new independence referendum is “not necessary or desirable”.
Thousands have signed up to hear the first minister and SNP leader address the event in George Square, organised by Scotland’s only independence-supporting daily newspaper, the National.
Sturgeon has not addressed a gathering of the wider yes movement since 2014 and has been criticised by some activists for not supporting a series of well-attended marches held across Scotland over the summer.
