Topline: In today’s era of increased scrutiny and calls for regulation around data privacy, security breaches are bad news for both corporations and consumers, often having a negative effect on a company’s stock price—although that impact has decreased in recent years as Wall Street becomes used to more frequent data breaches.
Surprising fact: Companies that experienced a breach actually performed better in the six months after, with average share price growing by 7.4%, compared to 4.1% growth in the six months before.
Tangent: Even major outages can affect stock prices. Bank of America, for instance, had an outage last week that left thousands of customers locked out of their accounts for over an hour, resulting in a nearly 2% drop in its share price.
