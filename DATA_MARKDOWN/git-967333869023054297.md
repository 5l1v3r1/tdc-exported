        MOSCOW (Sputnik) â€“ The Indian government held on Sunday a high-level meeting to discuss the environmental situation in the northern part of the country, which was described by the cabinet as an emergency.
      
The Indian capital of New Delhi, as well as surrounding regions, are currently engulfed in dense smog, caused by stubble burning, busy traffic, industrial production, and poor weather conditions. The city authorities called on people not to leave homes and temporarily closed schools. Some flights were also canceled over the smog.
