        My Chemical Romance are back!
      
Yep, after years of silence, the original American pop emos have announced that they’ll be playing a few (extremely) select shows. Will this lead to more music? Perhaps a bigger, longer tour?
Nobody has any clue. In fact, all the internet does know for sure at this stage are two things: 1) that everyone is very, very excited, and 2) that pretty much everybody has missed out on tickets.
The latter point is to be expected, really. You’ve gotta be ridiculously fast on the trigger to get tickets to shows that popular and limited, and there were always going to be a lot of people missing out.
At least those who didn’t get their foot in the door are taking it in their stride, celebrating with some delightfully bitter memes.
