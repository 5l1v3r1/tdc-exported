        Two years after teasing the idea of a Tesla pickup truck, the company will unveil it later this month.
      
Tesla will reveal its highly anticipated but so far unseen electric pickup truck on November 21, Elon Musk announced on Twitter on Wednesday. 
Musk called the electric pickup truck the 'Cybertruck' and says Tesla intends to unveil it in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory.
