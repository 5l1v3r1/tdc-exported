Real Madrid missed the chance to move to the top of La Liga as they were held to a goalless draw by Real Betis at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
Barcelona had slipped up earlier in the day, losing at Levante, while Atletico Madrid were held by Sevilla. However, Zinedine Zidane's side were unable to break down Betis.
They thought they were ahead inside 10 minutes when Eden Hazard scored, only for VAR to rule the goal out for offside. Left-back Ferland Mendy then passed up their best chance later in the half.
The draw sees Madrid move level with Barça on 22 points from 11 games, but they trail the Catalans on goal difference.
Atletico and Sevilla are one point back on 21 points having played a game more, while Granada (20 points) could go top on Sunday if they beat Real Sociedad, although they also will have played one more match than Madrid and Barça.
