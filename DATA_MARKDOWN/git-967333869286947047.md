Students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) are demonstrating against the institution's draft dormitory manual which has proposed introducing changes like raising dormitory fees, enforcement of dress codes,Â imposing a curfew on students and barring students from participating in protests.
Hundreds of students have gathered at the university premises and raising slogans while playing trumpets and beating drums and carrying banners, and posters.
The protesters have blasted the draft dormitory manual, saying it goes against the idea of the institution of higher education.
