Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden were among the cast members evacuated from the set of Marvel film The Eternals after a bomb was found, according to reports. 
The cast and crew of the movie were taken to safety in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, after the unexploded device was found and bomb disposal experts were called to the scene.
A source from the set told The Sun: “It was obviously terrifying – the bomb could have been there for decades untouched but who knows what might have happened if it was disturbed.”
It is not yet known where the bomb originated or how it came to be in Fuerteventura. However the island was previously used as a German military base during the Second World War.
The forthcoming film, which also stars Kit Harington, centres around a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilisations.
The Eternals will be released in UK cinemas on 6 November 2020.
