        Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier sparked rumours over a possible rematch with Donald Trump in 2020, and now the failed Democratic candidate is giving advice to fellow politicians about potential strategies to win the upcoming presidential election.
      
Former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has urged Democratic Party supporters to choose a nominee who will be able to win the Electoral College in 2020 and called on them to “close ranks” behind the chosen Democratic candidate, notwithstanding initial preferences in the primary, as quoted by The Hill. Clinton’s comments were made during an event in Denver devoted to the discussion of her book “The Book of Gutsy Women” co-authored with her daughter Chelsea Clinton, who appeared alongside her mother during the presentation.  
“I think several of our candidates could win the popular vote but as I know ... that's not enough", the former US secretary of state added.
Hillary Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic nominee running against Donald Trump, won the popular vote among the American public but failed to secure an Electoral College victory, meaning that she failed to gain a majority of the 538 electors established by the US Constitution, thus paving way for Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Netizens were eager to point out how Clinton’s pledge ran contrary to her 2016 stance.
