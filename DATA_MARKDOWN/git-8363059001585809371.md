Here in 2019, we don't bother frying whole chocolate bars anymore – well not at Poppies fish 'n' chip shop in Camden at least.
Throughout December, you'll be able to stroll into Poppies of Soho's Camden locale and order yourself a bag of battered Quality Street in place of your cod and chips - or as well as, depending on how hungry you are.
For £2.50 you'll get a lucky dip bag of five, which could well be anything, and for those of you who are so adamant that the fruit ones are so bloody delicious, I hope that's all you get. Enjoy your battered orange, and strawberry nightmares.
The treats/abominations will be available from December 1 to 25 and is sure to cause many a heart attack - or come very close. [Londonist]
