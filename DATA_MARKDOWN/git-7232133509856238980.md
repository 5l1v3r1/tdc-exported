After a brief period of trading above its long-established resistance level at $0.30, XRP has once again fallen back into the upper-$0.20 region, which may mean that it is in for an extended bout of sideways trading.
Analysts are still optimistic, however, that the cryptocurrency could see further gains in the near-term, with one analyst setting a target at $0.45 – which would mark a significant surge from its current price levels.
At the time of writing, XRP is trading up just under 1% at its current price of just under $0.30, which is around where it has been trading for the past several days.
XRP’s inability to decisively close above $0.30 does signal that bears still have strength in spite of the crypto’s recovery from its multi-month lows of $0.24, but it is important to note that any notable break above this level could spark a major uptrend for the embattled crypto.
Loma, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes a break above $0.30 could be sparked by the ongoing Ripple Swell conference, but further adding that there is a decent chance that XRP does not incur its annual “Swell pump” this year.
