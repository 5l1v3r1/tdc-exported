Microsoft today released a new update for the Microsoft News app in the Apple App Store. Aside from taking the app to Version 3.2.28, the update brings dark mode support for iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 users — yes, Microsoft News app on iOS 13 now supports iOS system-side Dark Mode.
This means that the Microsoft News app will now respect iOS 13 theme settings. In other words, if you set Dark Mode as default on your iPhone that runs iOS 13, you’ll notice the exact same effect in the Microsoft News app too.
Aside from Microsoft News, Microsoft To Do app for iOS also got support for Dark Mode a few days ago. Other Microsoft apps that have support iOS 13 Dark Mode are OneDrive, Office apps, SwiftKey, Microsoft Edge.
