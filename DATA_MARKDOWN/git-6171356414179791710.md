Welcome to the first full of November. I hope you all enjoyed your weekend and Daylight Savings â€” I spent the entire time working on my NaNoWriMo project. But y'all didn't come here to read me talk about that; no, you're here for some fresh app sales! Yes, today's list is small for a Monday, but it includes the Android port for Neverwinter Nights.
