        The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is no stranger to finding itself in hot water. It seems it’s hard to pick the worst gaffe – not awarding Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick for their works but naming Rocky the Best Picture, or allowing host Seth MacFarlane to sing “we saw your boobs”. However, this story may top all other blunders.
      
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has disqualified Nigeria’s movie from the International Film category, saying it had too much dialogue in English, despite the fact that the official language in Nigeria is… English. According to the academy’s rules, movies submitted in the International Film category should have predominantly non-English dialogue. Lionheart, directed by Genevieve Nnaji, who also stars in the film, has less than 12 minutes of dialogue that is in the Igbo language and the rest of the movie is in English.
Director Genevieve Nnaji took to Twitter to criticise the academy’s decision, saying English serves as a bridge between more than 500 languages that are spoken in Nigeria.
