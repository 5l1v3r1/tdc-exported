Google’s Pixel 4 debuts a new feature which makes it easy to save individual frames of video as still photos.When using the Google Photos app to edit a video, the Pixel 4 presents an updated version of the interface which adds a new textual ‘Export frame’ button placed prominently below the video clip.
At the same time, this new button edges out the familiar ‘Stabilize’ and ‘Rotate’ functions to the sides of the screen where they have been reduced from text-based labels to somewhat less descriptive icons.
The process of saving a still image from your video is easy: simply slide your finger along the timeline to reach your desired moment in the video, then tap ‘Export frame’ to have it instantly saved to your gallery. On the Pixel 4, the whole process is smooth, quick and easy.
Because you’re saving from a video file that’s limited to 1080p or 4K resolution the picture quality won’t be as high as a regular photo, but this is a great way to freeze important details that might otherwise have been missed.
At the time of writing, the Pixel 3 doesn’t yet offer this feature, but hopefully we’ll see it roll out to other devices soon.
