SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Elias Pettersson scored two goals, Thatcher Demko had 24 saves and the Vancouver Canucks beat the San Jose Sharks 5-2 on Saturday night.
Brandon Sutter, Jake Virtanen and Adam Gaudette also scored as the Canucks (9-3-2) won for the ninth time in 12 games.
Marc-Edouard Vlasic scored a short-handed goal for San Jose (4-10-1), which has lost five straight and seven of eight.
Demko, a 23-year-old former Boston College standout who won the Mike Richter Award for the most outstanding Division I NCAA goalie in 2016, was seeking his first career shutout when Vlasic scored his second goal of the season with just over nine minutes left in the game.
