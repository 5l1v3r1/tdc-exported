Stranger Things is three seasons in, and a fourth is on the way, having been officially confirmed by Netflix. Here's everything we know about Stranger Things 4 so far, including the possible release date and plot rumours.
Series creators the Duffer brothers had previously suggested that the show would only run for four seasons before coming to a close, though since then we've heard that it may run a little longer than that.
We don't have any release date for the fourth season yet, so there's no firm answer. So far there's been a gap of roughly a year and a half between each season, and with season three dropping in July 2019, we'd imagine late 2020 is a good bet.
The first season dropped in July, while the second was October, and the third went back to July. So October 2020 seems plausible, to hit that Halloween theme once more, though we wouldn't be surprised if the Duffers want to explore a new time period - we haven't yet seen anything set in winter, for example. Stranger Things Christmas or Thanksgiving special, anyone?
