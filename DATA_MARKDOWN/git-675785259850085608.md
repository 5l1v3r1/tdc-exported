Police have issued a direct appeal for two wanted brothers to come forward as part of the investigation into the deaths of 39 migrants found dead in a lorry.
The bodies of the eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry at an industrial park in Essex early on the morning of October 23.
The discovery triggered a huge investigation which is being led by Essex Police.
Police are hunting two brothers on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter in the weeks since the tragic discovery.
Ronan Hughes, 40, and Christopher Hughes, 34, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, are believed to run a haulage business.
Lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, from Craigavon, Northern Ireland, faces charges includingÂ  39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people and money laundering.
He will appear at the Old Bailey later month.
