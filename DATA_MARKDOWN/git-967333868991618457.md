The shooter at a college Halloween party in East Texas killed two people and injured a dozen more, AP reported.
Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said Tuesday in a statement cited by AP that additional information and the refusal of witnesses to cooperate with the investigation undermined the case against the suspect.
