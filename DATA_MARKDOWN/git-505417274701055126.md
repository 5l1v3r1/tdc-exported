        Canelo Álvarez cemented his spot at the top of the world’s best pound-for-pound pugilists by flattening Sergey Kovalev to claim the WBO light heavyweight title in Las Vegas.
      
The Mexican stepped up two whole weight classes to face heavy hitter Kovalev. The fight may have lacked the action that fans desired from two of the game’s greats with the crowd at the MGM Grand booing on occasion.
However, the stoppage proved to be worth the entrance fee alone as Canelo dropped his opponent with a powerful left-right combination late in the eleventh round.
