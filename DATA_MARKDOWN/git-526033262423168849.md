President Donald Trump said Friday that his decision to change his official residency from New York to Florida was about respect and not taxes – even though he continued to complain at length about how much he’s paid to New York City and the state.

“They haven't treated me properly," he told reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Mississippi. "I pay millions of taxes.

He then added: “I don't mind paying the taxes. New York is a very expensive place to live.”
The president went on to take a swipe at the city he’s long called home, saying “many bad things” are happening there and referred reporters to the “statement” he said he had just put out -- a seeming reference to tweets he fired off shortly before coming out to the South Lawn.
