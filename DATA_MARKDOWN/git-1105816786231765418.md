Pakistan has welcomed the conclusion of the landmark “Riyadh agreement”, as a result of the initiative taken by the Saudi Arabia leadership and supported by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government.
“We believe it is a crucial and important step forward towards a political solution and durable peace and security in Yemen,” Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a tweet on Wednesday.
