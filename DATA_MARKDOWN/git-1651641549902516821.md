There has been a lot of signs over the last few years that Microsoft is de-emphasising the Microsoft Store. These included a greater focus on Win32 apps, making Windows 10 S a mode rather than an OS, releasing apps first to the web rather than the store and allowing developers to install managed apps directly from their websites.
Today another developer raised some more evidence, noting that Microsoft Store support has become increasingly difficult to contact.
