Cancel culture is making headlines again after former President Barack Obama stepped in to have a dig at the way people are acting online.
Obama said that call-out culture wasn’t a great form of activism and is way more about making people feel self-satisfied than actually making change.
He’s received a lot of mainstream support for his comments, including an entirely unironic slow-clap from MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough.
But was Obama right to say what he did?
Look, it’s complicated.
