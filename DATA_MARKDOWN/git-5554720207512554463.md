Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa, who famously dissented on the poll code violations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah during this year’s Lok Sabha polls, has found himself under the scanner from the power ministry. This was after a newspaper reported that the Modi government had asked 11 public sector undertakings to verify whether Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa had exercised ‘undue influence’ during his tenure in the power ministry from 2009 to 2013.
No sooner did The Indian Express carry the news earlier this week, former bureaucrats, journalists, social media users and the opposition Congress began to rally behind the technocrat. IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, who recently resigned protesting the government crackdown in Kashmir, wrote on Twitter, “An Election Commissioner who had shown interest in finding out the vulnerabilities in the EVM-VVPAT process is targeted by the government. We will keep quiet now too. And let them tarnish his image & discredit him.”
