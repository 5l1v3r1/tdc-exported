Hellas Verona fans had targeted the 29-year-old striker throughout the match, singing racist chants from the stands at the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi.
By the 50th minute, Balotelli could stand it no more. He booted the ball into the area where the racist chanting could be heard, and attempted to storm off the pitch.
