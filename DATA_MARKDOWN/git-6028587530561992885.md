This is a developing story.Topline: Responding to pressure from critics and Democratic rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren outlined her plan to fund “Medicare For All” without raising taxes on the middle class, instead calling for tax increases on businesses and billionaires to provide free health coverage for all Americans.
Key background: Warren has risen steadily in the polls in recent months, now challenging former vice president Joe Biden atop the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field. Warren had repeatedly been pressed by top rivals to provide further details of how she’d pay for her healthcare plan and is now finally offering details about how to implement the monumental program without taking a chunk out of middle-class salaries.
Crucial quote: “We don’t need to raise taxes on the middle class by one penny to finance Medicare for All,” Warren wrote in a Medium post detailing her plan on Friday.
