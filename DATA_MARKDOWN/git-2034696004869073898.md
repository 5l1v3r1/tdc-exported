Yungblud – aka Dominic Harrison – has unveiled a chilling new music video for ‘Die A Little’, his contribution to the soundtrack of the third season of Netflix’s teen drama 13 Reasons Why.
The clip, according to Yungblud in a press release, is a “call out to take mental health seriously”. It was shot in Bulgaria and directed by Andrew Sandler, who previously worked on the singer’s ‘Hope For The Underrated Youth’ visual, the lead single from his latest EP of the same name.
