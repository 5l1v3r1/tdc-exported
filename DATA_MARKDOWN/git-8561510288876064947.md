On Thursday, the Keystone Pipeline spilled about 383,000 gallons of crude oil in North Dakota.
It’s nothing short of an environmental disaster — and it probably won’t be the last time that the particularly-leaky pipeline spills, experts told The New York Times. The pipeline, which the U.S. government said in 2011 would pose “no significant impact” to the area, has now flooded half an acre of wetland with toxic sludge.
The spill has been contained, the NYT reports. But compared to actually cleaning the area, that’s the easy part.
“It is one of the larger spills in the state,” Karl Rockeman, a director at North Dakota’s Department of Environmental Quality, told the NYT.
