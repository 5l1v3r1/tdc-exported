O’Rourke had everything going for him as he entered the presidential race: A post-Senate race media coverage glow, a big appearance with Oprah, a private meeting with former President Barack Obama, and winning some of the top political talent in the business to help him run his campaign.
But his lack of discipline and poor fundraising ultimately doomed his campaign as he grew impatient with the process of running for president.
Here is a look back at the big moments in Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke’s campaign:
“I want to be in it. Man, I’m just born to be in it,” he told Vanity Fair right before announcing his presidential run.
O’Rourke was riding high after photographer Annie Leibovitz followed him around Texas as he organized a counter-rally against President Donald Trump, who was also rallying in Beto’s hometown of El Paso.
