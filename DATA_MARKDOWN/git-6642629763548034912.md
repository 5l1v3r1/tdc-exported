Lebanese demonstrators have begun surrounding government institutions in the capital, Beirut, and other cities, as a mass protest movement demanding an overhaul of the country's political system approaches its fourth week.
The move on Wednesday suggests a shift in the focus of protesters from blocking roads and setting up barricades to holding sit-ins at state-affiliated sites as they seek to maintain pressure on the political establishment until their demands for the departure of the ruling elite and an end to chronic economic mismanagement and corruption are met.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Beirut, said a group of protesters had arrived and gathered in front of the Ministry of Justice to call for accountability.
"They want to see the next step happening, which is the president announcing a date for consultations ... for a new prime minister and a new government to be formed," she said.
