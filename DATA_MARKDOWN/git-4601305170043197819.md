A ruling by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Trump's accounting firm to hand over his tax returns to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr today.
From to Business Insider:
Of course this doesn't mean he will â€“ in fact, we all know he won't. He'll instead "appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court" says one of his attorneys, Jay Sekulow.
According to NPR:
But in the end, does it even matter if he hands over his tax returns or not? After all, one of Trump's henchmen, er, lawyers, William Consovoy, "argued that local law-enforcement authorities could not investigate Trump even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue."
