Sports radio broadcasting great Kevin Harlan had some fun Monday night when a black cat invaded MetLife Stadium during the New York Giants’ game against the Dallas Cowboys.
The cat was spotted at midfield toward the end of the second quarter. Referees stopped play for about 2 minutes before the cat cleared the field.

While fans at the stadium and on social media were mystified by the feline, Harlan made sure the radio audience got the full dramatic experience.
Harlan called the cat’s invasion as if the animal was running a football into the end zone. He even threw in a sponsor during his broadcast call. He also likened the cat’s elusiveness to star running backs Saquon Barkley, of the Giants, and Ezekiel Elliott, of the Cowboys.
