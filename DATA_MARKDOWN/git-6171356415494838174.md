For most people, a locked bootloader is no big deal. However, some Android users demand an unlockable bootloader so they can tinker with the software on their phones. Many devices are completely locked down, but HMD might be easing up a bit. The recently launched Nokia 7.2 is apparently the company's first phone with an unlockable bootloader.
Unlocking the bootloader on a phone allows you to flash whatever software you want to the internal partitions. For example, you can replace the recovery with TWRP or flash a custom Android ROM downloaded from XDA Forums. Unlocking the bootloader opens the door to all that customization, but it comes with security risks. Thus, many devices require workarounds or hacks to unlock, but the Nokia 7.2 is very much like a Pixel. You just need a few minutes and a computer with Fastboot.
