Quentin Tarantino has revealed his favourite film of 2019.
The director released his latest movie Once Upon A Time In Hollywood in the UK back in August.
Now, in a new interview with Deadline, Tarantino, who is always vocal about the films he admires, reveals that his number one choice for the year (so far) is July’s horror flick Crawl.
Starring Kaya Scodelario (Skins), the Sam Raimi-produced film sees the cast surrounded by a hell of a lot of alligators.

As part of the interview, journalist Pete Hammond reveals: “Tarantino told me that, as incredible as he says it might sound, he thinks his favourite film so far this year just might be – wait for it – Crawl.
“That’s right, the alligators-in-a-hurricane movie directed by Alexandre Aja that Paramount released a couple of weeks before QT’s movie came out in July.”
NME‘s Jordan Bassett called Crawl a “brutally effective and gore-splattered horror.”
