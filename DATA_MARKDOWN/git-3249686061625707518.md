Shuhua of (G)I-DLE and Tzuyu of TWICE recently went out together to celebrate the birthday of Elkie of CLC.
Elkie shared some of their cute photos on Instagram calling the two female idols her "amazing friends".
It wasn't too long ago that Tzuyu and Elkie celebrated Gugudan's Sally's birthday along with Dreamcatcher's Handong. 
This group of pretty foreign Kpop idols spends a lot of time together during their rest days and it seems that their clique is growing with the addition of Shuhua who's from the same home country as Tzuyu - Taiwan.
