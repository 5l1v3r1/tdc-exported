PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- A middle school student in Port Charlotte says a man asked her to get in his car while walking to school.
It happened Tuesday morning on Kenesaw Street near Castlerock Lane.
According to a Charlotte County Sheriff's Office report, the child told deputies that she was walking to Murdock Middle School when a maroon SUV pulled up to her. She says the man inside started asking questions and then asked her to get inside the vehicle.
When the driver appeared to get upset when she refused to get in, the girl ran to the nearby homeless coalition.
A witness at the coalition confirmed the child's report, and says he saw the SUV circling the area for hours before the incident.
The suspect is described as a white male with dirty blonde hair and clean shaven face, chubby, wearing a baseball cap with a collared white shirt with tan stripes.
The vehicle is described as a maroon 2007-2009 Jeep Liberty SUV with an unknown temporary tag.
Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office .
