(UPDATED) Well, readers, if you thought pugnacious Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. is going to apologize to the reporter he verbally abused early this week, you’re very much mistaken.
In fact, Locsin is still fuming at The Philippine Daily Inquirer journalist Jhesset Enano, whom he accused of slandering President Rodrigo Duterte in a tweet today. He also slammed the Inquirer, perhaps the country’s most-lauded publication, as an “idiot newspaper,” and petulantly demanded an apology on the president’s behalf.
“I will apologize to the lady [if] she apologizes to Duterte for her slanders and that idiot newspaper vows never to slant stories about him again,” he fumed, before going on to simultaneously flex his vocab muscles and underline his well-known capacity for contemptuous online speech.
“I have an inexhustible (sic) supply of scurrilities,” he added.
(Generally people don’t brag about being scurrilous, but if anyone would, we guess it’d be ol’ T-Loc.)
“Her and the Inquirer’s president works his ass off for the country,” Locsin continued. “Say sorry. Now.”
