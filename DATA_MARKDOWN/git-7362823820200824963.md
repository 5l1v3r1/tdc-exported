President Trump joined congressional Republicans in publicly rejecting the Ukraine call whistleblower's offer to respond to written questions from Republican lawmakers, instead insisting that he or she appear in person as part of the impeachment inquiry -- a move that would reveal the anonymous official's identity.
The whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, tweeted over the weekend that his client -- whose complaint about Trump's July phone call with the president of Ukraine touched off the impeachment probe -- would provide sworn, written answers under penalty of perjury. Trump in turn attacked the whistleblower's credibility and demanded in-person testimony.

Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!"
