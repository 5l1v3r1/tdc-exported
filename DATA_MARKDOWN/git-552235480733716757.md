The Premier League has explained why Son Heung-Min was sent off in the incident which led to a horror injury for Everton 's Andre Gomes.
The South Korean international made a challenge in the second half of the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park which led to a very serious injury to his opponent.
Son appeared to be trying to halt the counter-attack, but the way Gomes fell caused what appeared to be a very serious leg break.
The Tottenham player was devastated by the injury he had caused, and was in tears as he was dismissed by referee Martin Atkinson.
The official had initially booked Son before upgrading to a red card and the Premier League has now explained why.
A statement said: "The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge."
In essence Son was deemed to have endangered Gomes' safety by definition, given the sickening injury he suffered.
His team-mate, England international Dele Alli, told Sky Sports after the match: "Son is devastated and in tears. It’s not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you’ve ever met. He can’t even lift his head up, he’s crying so much."
