        Binance has told its customers to take precautions as BitMEX announces a mass leak of its users email addresses from an internal error.Â 
      
Recently, BitMEX users discovered that they could openly view the email addresses of other users after they received an official email related to an update. BitMEX sent the email to everyone and mistakenly listed all the email addresses in carbon copy (CC) rather than in blind carbon copy (BCC), which allowed all of the addresses to be seen.
