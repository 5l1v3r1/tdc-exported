Cape Town – Talented American rapper Nipsey Hussle, was killed earlier this year in a shooting. He was 33.
The artist, who earned a Grammy nomination this year for his major-label debut, was profoundly respected in South Los Angeles where he grew up.
In the months following the incident, a man named Eric Holder has been charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder in connection with the alleged murder.
Now, according to Forbes, Nipsey has racked up $11 million (over R 162 million)  over the last year, putting him at the number 10 spot on the list of top-earning dead celebrities.
The publication also reports that rapper earned more money posthumously than he did while alive.
Nipsey has also garnered 1.8 billion streams over the last year, which places him among the top three most-streamed artists, living or deceased.
