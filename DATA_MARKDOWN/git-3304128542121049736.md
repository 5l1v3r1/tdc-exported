Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale took to his heels a few minutes after showing up in Kibra’s Laini Saba. He was trying to make his way to YMCA Polling Station.
It is believed that the former lawmaker had turned up to show support for Jubilee candidate and flag bearer in Kibra by-elections McDonald Mariga.
