McDonald's has apologised for a Halloween marketing campaign in Portugal that referenced one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland sectarian conflict.
The advert ran pictures of its new sundae ice creams with the pun: "Sundae Bloody Sundae".
Bloody Sunday saw 13 people killed when British soldiers opened fire at a civil rights march in Derry/Londonderry on January 30, 1972.
The advert, which started circulating on social media, drew a lot of criticism from users, with some calling it "appalling".
