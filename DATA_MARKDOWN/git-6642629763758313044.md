The United States official, whose whistle-blower complaint led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, has offered to answer written questions submitted by House Republicans, his lawyers said.
The surprise offer on Sunday, made to Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence committee leading the inquiry, would allow Republicans to ask questions of the whistle-blower without having to go through the committee's Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff.
Lawyer Mark Zaid said the whistle-blower would answer questions directly from Republican members "in writing, under oath & penalty of perjury", part of a bid to stem escalating efforts by Trump and his allies to unmask the person's identity.
Only queries seeking the person's identity will not be answered, he said, adding the Republican bid to expose his client's identity "could jeopardise their safety, as well as that of their family".
"We will ensure timely answers," he said.
