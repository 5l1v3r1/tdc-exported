        A little girl has won hearts all across the world following what could well be the cutest interrogation ever caught on camera.
      
Young Mila came home one day, bold as brass, in a jacket her parents had never seen before. But rather than break down and confess to her cloakroom crime, she withstood her dad’s patient line of questioning like a criminal mastermind.
