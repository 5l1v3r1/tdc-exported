Cloud gaming is the latest frontier tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, are trying to crack into. It seems Valve wants a piece of the pie too with new partner codes indicating its working on a cloud gaming service for its Steam platform to make it a reality.
Spotted on GitHub by Steam Database's Twitter, 22 new files containing partner codes have been added to GitHub suggesting something called 'Steam Cloud Gaming' is being worked on.
