New interview notes from Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation have been received and released by CNN on Saturday.
CNN had previously sued the US Department of Justice for access to the Mueller team's interview notes which allegedly show that Trump's 2016 campaign team discussed in private how they could get access to the Democratic e-mails obtained by WikiLeaks.
The notes reveal that Trump's former campaign official Steve Bannon told the Mueller team that Trump was allegedly wanted to ''get the emails'' that were hacked by WikiLeaks.
Additionally, those emails are also claimed by Trump's opponents from the Democratic party to have been ''stolen by Russians'', which both Donald Trump and Russia have repeatedly dismissed.
Earlier in July, a US federal court dismissed the multi-million dollar lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee last year against the Russian Federation, WikiLeaks, the Trump campaign, and several senior Trump administration officials. President Trump also praised the decision by the court on his official Twitter page.
