Back in 2015, it first came to our attention that a new vehicle was in development that was looking to make a genuine stake at the world land speed record.
With the record currently set (and held) by the Thrust SSC in 1997 (with a speed of 763MPH) this was, and is, clearly a lofty task. The Bloodhound SSC, however, all going well, wanted to not only break this record, but to smash it by a huge margin!
Figures of 1,000MPH+ have regularly been touted for the vehicle, however, financial difficulties last year resulted in the project (temporarily) being scrapped.
Fortunately, new investment was found and in the first test since then, the Bloodhound SSC has reported achieving a speed of 461MPH. Better still, you can watch it happen in the video below!
