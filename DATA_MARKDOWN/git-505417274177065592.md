        The Ulster Council has confirmed that ‘finish-on-the-day’ protocols will remain in place for the remainder of the Ulster club championship after two games were decided by penalty shootouts at the weekend.
      
In Brewster Park, Derrygonnelly progressed to the senior semi-final following a classic encounter with Tyrone champions Trillick. The Fermanagh champions eventually prevailing 6-5 on penalty kicks after Lee Brennan struck the post for Trillick in sudden death.
In the Ulster junior semi-final at Celtic Park, another Tyrone club, Rock St Patrick’s, lost to Donegal side Buncrana after another shootout.
The decision to decide important fixtures via this method has not gone down well in certain circles with Declan Bogue reporting that the Ulster Council are sticking to the recommendation set down from Congress earlier this year.
