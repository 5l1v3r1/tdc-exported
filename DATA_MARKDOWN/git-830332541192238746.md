RICHLAND CENTER, Wis. - Richland Center Police Chief Lucas Clements resigned from the city police department on Monday. The Police Commission unanimously approved the move at its meeting the same night.
Clements was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft on Tuesday for an incident in June, when he was accused of groping a bartender and stealing her tips. Clements has been on paid leave with the department since late June.
