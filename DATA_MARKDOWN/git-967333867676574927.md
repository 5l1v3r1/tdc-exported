The Saudi-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthis at the internationally recognised Yemeni government’s request since March 2015.
In response, Houthis regularly attack Saudi border areas. In September, the attack on the kingdom’s oil facilities resulted in Saudi Arabia's net oil output falling by half.
