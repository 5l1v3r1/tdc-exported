A George Michael song from the pop star’s final recording sessions will be released almost three years after his death.
This Is How (We Want You To Get High) began in early 2012, and its finishing touches were added in late 2015.
Michael died at the age of 53 on Christmas Day 2016.
His lyrics in the song see the star “addressing society’s ills with his trademark blend of self-deprecation and wry humour”, Michael’s record label said
