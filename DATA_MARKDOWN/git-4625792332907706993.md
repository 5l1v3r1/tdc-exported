A 7-year-old trick-or-treater was one of two people shot by a stray bullet in a Chicago gang shooting on Thursday night.
The trick-or-treater, who was reported to be wearing either a bumblebee or Minnie Mouse costume, was hit by a stray bullet after members of rival gangs opened fire around 5:30 p.m. on Halloween. The girl was shot in the neck, leaving her in critical condition as of Friday morning.
Authorities said the girl was trick-or-treating with a 31-year-old man. While the duo was walking, three men on the other side of the street got into an altercation and opened fire.
Police claimed neither the girl nor the man with her was targets of the shooting, though both were hit with stray bullets.
The man was hospitalized but listed in stable condition.
