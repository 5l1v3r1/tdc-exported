A taxi driver has caused netizens' blood to boil after attacking an innocent woman who was crossing the street.
According to news reports, last month in Gwangju, aÂ taxi driver lost control of his anger and left his car to hit the woman. It was reported that he was angry because the woman was crossing the road too slowly for his liking. MBC News revealed the CCTV footage of the incident on November 6 which you can view below.
