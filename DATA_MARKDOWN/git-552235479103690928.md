The devastated family of a Scot who is fighting for his life after a horrific motorbike crash in Bali have launched a fund to help bring him home.
Reuben Armstrong, 27, left and above, originally from Alexandria in Dunbartonshire but now living in Grimsby, is in hospital on the Asian island after injuring his head in the smash.
He suffered frontal lobe damage and was initially in a coma before undergoing brain surgery.
His family are trying to raise £50,000 to bring him home and settle hospital bills after his insurance company failed to pay out as he wasn’t wearing a helmet.
IT professional Reuben splits his working time between London and Bali.
