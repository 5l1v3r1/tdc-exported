Okay, you’re here, so it’s pretty safe to assume you’ve fallen victim to watching The Masked Singer. Don’t worry, it’s okay—I can totally understand why! After working your very stressful 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift, the last thing you wanna do is watch television that will stress you out! And just like that, in comes The Masked Singer, perhaps the most delightfully preposterous competition show to hit television in recent years. The show has blessed us with celebs cosplaying as food, inanimate objects, actual animals...literally anything and everything.

People have been solidifying their guesses for the Flamingo (Adrienne Bailon, maybe) and the Fox (Jeremy Renner, is that you?), so it’s only natural that theories are coming in about the majestic, glittering Butterfly...who may or may not be Michelle Williams of Destiny’s Child. I was skeptical at first, but the evidence really adds up. Let’s discuss!
