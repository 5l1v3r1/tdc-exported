Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s 54th birthday celebration was surely something to remember. The King of hearts as he is rightly called, made the day extra special for all his fans, especially those who flocked in large numbers to catch a glimpse of him at Mannat.
Not only did he ring in his day with fans at the stroke of midnight, but, he also made a second appearance later the same evening, and joined an auditorium full of fans for a fun interaction and celebration. After cutting his cake and delivering some of his best dialogues, King Khan also opened up about his kids and why his next films are so important for him.
