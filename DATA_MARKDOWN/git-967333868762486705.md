        Although the North Atlantic Alliance is now spending over $1 trillion on defence, more than all of its potential adversaries combined, the think tank’s ‘report card’ on US military readiness gave the armed forces just barely a passing grade, and said that the military was desperately underequipped to fight a potential two front war.
      
The Heritage Foundation’s 2020 Index of US Military Strength, a 500+ page document on the US military and its key potential adversaries, lists Russia, China and Iran alongside Middle Eastern terrorism as “aggressive” threats to American interests around the globe.
Russia, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank claims, “remains the primary threat to American interests in Europe,” and is “the most pressing threat to the United States” in general.
Heritage also points to Russia’s $61.4 billion in military spending “investment in modernizing its military,” not mentioning that NATO’s combined defence budget was over $1 trillion in 2018, with the US alone spending over $649 billion on the military.
The think tank goes on to accuse Moscow of “continuing to sabotage US and Western policy in Syria and Ukraine,” even though Moscow's military assistance to the Middle Eastern country was provided at the request of Syria's UN-recognised government, and Russia's involvement in Ukraine is limited to acting as a mediator in the country's half-decade old civil war, brought on by a Western-backed coup in Kiev in 2014.
