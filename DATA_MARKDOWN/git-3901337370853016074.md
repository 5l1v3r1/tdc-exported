In what was his last appearance for his club and maybe his final match as a professional footballer, African legend Yaya Toure was sent off after just 10 seconds following a moment of madness this past weekend.

The former Manchester City midfielder celebrated yet another trophy win on Saturday after claiming the China League One title with Qingdao Huanghai.
His final game for the team was a disappointing one, however, as he was given his marching orders less than a minute into their clash against Nantong Zhiyun for strangely kicking out an opponent off the ball.
