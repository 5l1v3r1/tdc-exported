Marcus Morris, Flask Dad himself, is a master of pettiness. Makes sense he’d do his best to beat the Celtics on his own in his new Knicks threads, in light of today’s report regarding his surprise at Boston not calling him in free agency.
As you might imagine, “Marcus Morris trying to win basically on his own” didn’t make for aesthetically appealing basketball. Nor did “Celtics not being able to shoot, like, at all, for long stretches.” Mook did, in the end, have an excellent game (29-9-3 plus 2 steals) and hit a would-be dagger in the game’s final 10 seconds—but was undone by Jayson Tatum’s counter-dagger (part of a 24-6-3 game) that ultimately won the game for the Cs 104-102.
They wouldn’t have got there at all, however, if not for the consistent intensity of Kemba Walker, who shot inconsistently but absolutely feasted at the charity stripe (14-14 FT) en route to an excellent 33-6-5 performance (plus 1 steal).
This game should’ve been easy but was ultimately kinda sloppy, in no small part due to the absence of potential scorers like Jaylen Brown and Enes Kanter. But it was ultimately a W. Let’s take a more granular but still breezy look at the contest thanks to you beautiful weird geniuses on Twitter.
