Team Hogan, comprised of Roman Reigns, Ricochet, Ali, Shorty G and Rusev, faced off against Team Flair at WWE Crown Jewel. Randy Orton, Bobby Lashley, Shinsuke Nakamura, Drew McIntyre and Baron Corbin, all stepped up for The Nature Boy, but they were unable to secure the win.
The match was packed with a lot of action including the clash between Rusev and Lashley, as they were both tagged in and exchanged blows. They are currently embroiled in a storyline with Lana, who is cheating on Rusev with Lashley.
