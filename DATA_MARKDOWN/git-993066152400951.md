PLANS to house 13 female asylum seekers in a Co Mayo hotel have been postponed due to continuing protests at the site.
The Achill Head Hotel in Keel had been selected as a location to provide emergency temporary accommodation for the women for up to three months.
In a statement the Department of Justice and Equality said the plan was being put on hold because "an ongoing protest remains in place outside the hotel".
The department expressed disappointment, but said it would continue to engage with local representatives in a bid to resolve the matter.
Last week, a public meeting in Achill heard fears of infrastructural pressures as a result of asylum seekers being moved to the community.
Sinn Féin senator Rose Conway-Walsh told RTÉ there had been a "vacuum of information" and the postponement gave the government an opportunity to "get this right".
