Matthew McConaughey is celebrating his 50th birthday with an announcement: He’s officially on Instagram.
On Monday, the actor posted a series of videos on both Twitter and the ’gram to ring in his new handle, which is, aptly, @officiallymcconaughey.
“Born November the 4th 1969, got my dad’s name the very same day. But not until I turned 50, today, did I become @officiallymcconaughey. That’s my Instagram handle. See you there,” says the Texas native in a video he tweeted.
