        The tech giant confirmed it is aware of the problem and is working to resolve it. The app appears to be broken across most major platforms, while other Amazon services (including Alexa) seem to be operating properly.
      
According to numerous reports, hundreds of users have not been able to connect to the Amazon Prime Video app. It apparently went down on Thursday morning. Media outlets have suggested that Amazon Prime Video was not working in the UK as late as 9:45 a.m. GMT.
