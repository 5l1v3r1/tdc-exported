Tuesday on CBS’s “This Morning” as part of his book tour for “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., revealed his favorite Democrat: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).
After the younger Trump was urged to “say something nice” on Twitter as the interview wrapped up, co-host Gayle King asked him to name his favorite Democrat.
Trump thought to himself for a moment and then jokingly replied, “Mitt Romney is my favorite Democrat.”
