A Victoria-based octet is set to swing into Surrey with a show that aims to recreate the sound and look of an iconic New York City ballroom.
With the music and script of “A Night at the Savoy,” Dock Side Drive takes audience members back to the night bandleader Glenn Miller died while fighting in the Second World War, in December of 1944.
“This show is a bit unique for us,” said the band’s Heather Burns, “because usually we’re a festival-event, stage-show band, but this show involves an actor as radio-show host.”
The music-heavy production was written in 2015 for a run of dinner-theatre shows in Victoria, said Burns, who is Dock Side Drive’s bandleader, singer, keyboardist and arranger.
On this side of the Strait of Georgia, they’ll perform at Surrey Arts Centre’s Main Stage on Saturday, Nov. 16, in another Surrey Civic Theatres presentation.
