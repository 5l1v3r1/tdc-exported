Colors TV’s reality show Bigg Boss is set to turn quite dramatic this week after a promo by the makers showed that Siddharth Shukla may be evicted out of the house for violence. A promo broadcast by the channel at the end of the Monday night’s episode showed Bigg Boss announce that it was booting out Siddharth for violence during a weekly task.
It’s not clear what the task was about and how he resorted to violence, but if the Colors TV broadcast on Monday night is true, then Siddharth will become the second most popular TV actor after Rashami Desai to leave the popular reality show.
The reported elimination of Siddharth has triggered strong reactions from Twitterati.
