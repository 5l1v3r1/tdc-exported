No one wanted any part of a black cat that strolled onto the field at MetLife Stadium during Monday's game between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys.
The cat was spotted on the 50-yard line near the end of the second quarter in between plays.
Play stopped for two minutes as the feline ran toward the endzone using its speed and lateral movement before stopping and crossing the goal line to cheer thousands in attendance.
