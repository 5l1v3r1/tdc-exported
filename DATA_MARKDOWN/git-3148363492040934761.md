Wright’s tweet features a video of Devin Nunes (R-CA) delivering a speech on the House floor, defending President Donald Trump against the Democrats’ ongoing push for impeachment.
“What we’re seeing among Democrats on the Intelligence Committee down in the SCIF right now is like a cult,” Nunes is seen saying in a video attached to Wright’s tweet. “These are a group of people loyally following their leader as he bounces from one outlandish conspiracy theory to another. And the media are the cult followers.”
Captioning his tweet, Jeffrey Wright said “Happy Halloween, I guess, folks.” The Westworld actor’s tweet also features short video with President Trump making facial gestures on the left and Manson making similar facial expressions on the right.
