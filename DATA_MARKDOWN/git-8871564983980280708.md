Unsuspecting tourists might not be aware that tensions are (still) high between taxi drivers and drivers of ride-hailing services (locally known as “online taxi”) in Bali, and Coconuts Bali suspects that might be the case for tourists in a video that went viral recently, where conventional taxi drivers appear to gang up on an online taxi driver in an attempt to stop the latter from doing his job. 
The two-minute video, which looks like it was taken at the Bali Collection shopping mall in Nusa Dua, shows two formally-dressed drivers (presumably the conventional taxi drivers) getting into an argument with an online taxi driver.
