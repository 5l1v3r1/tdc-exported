There was a boring interlude yesterday — lasting all of about ten minutes — when it seemed that after five or so years of Brexit high drama, the British political scene had once more become reassuringly dull.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson — finally — had got his general election; many of parliament’s wreckers and loonies — led by Speaker John Bercow — had disappeared into the sunset; now all that remained was for the Conservatives to win with a whopping majority, kick Jeremy Corbyn and his rabid Marxists into the dustbin of history, deliver Brexit and leave all of us to live happily ever after.
Then this morning Nigel Farage — with a little help from his American chum Donald — dropped his bombshell. The Brexit Party isn’t going to go down without a fight; it isn’t going to concede the field to the Conservatives; no, what Boris is promising definitely isn’t Brexit — so unless he changes his Withdrawal Agreement and forms some kind of loose alliance then the Brexit Party is going to contend every seat in the coming election, potentially splitting the Leave vote and exposing Britain to the double horror of No Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister.
It’s big, it’s bold, and I like it!
