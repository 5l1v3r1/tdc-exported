A candlelit vigil has been held for a cyclist who died after a collision with a lorry in Dublin.
Gardaí are investigating the crash on the South Circular Road at the junction of Bulfin Road at around 8.30am on Friday.
A crowd of around 60 people gathered at the scene and lit candles to remember the victim last night.
Local Green Party councillor Patrick Costello said there was an awareness among cyclists that any of them could have been the victim of such an incident.
“It’s important that at times like these that cyclists come together. There is an awareness that it could be any cyclist. There is shock and sadness and people were looking to support each other tonight,” he said.
