KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): RHB Retail Research said Econpile Holdings Bhd may rebound further after it tested 70 sen support in recent sessions.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said as the stock rose above the 21-day SMA line, this indicates a positive sign.
“A positive bias may emerge above the 73.5 sen level, with an exit set below the 70 sen threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the 78.5 sen level, followed by the 82 sen threshold,” it said.
