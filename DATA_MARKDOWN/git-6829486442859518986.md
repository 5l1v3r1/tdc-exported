The King, Netflix’s historical drama starring Timothée Chalamet as an approximation of Shakespeare’s Henry V, has been receiving pretty mixed reviews for being dreary, if not dull. But one standout, for better or worse, depending on your mileage, is Robert Pattinson as the Dauphin, rocking long frocks and a questionable French accent.
While the David Michôd-directed film is clearly supposed to help transition Chalamet from twink-heartthrob to serious actor, it’s Pattinson who steals the show in a relatively small role. Appearing over an hour into The King, Pattinson commands attention as Henry’s rival due to an energy that can only be described as chaotic: where Chalamet plays things quite seriously, Pattinson has a lot of fun with his menacing role.
