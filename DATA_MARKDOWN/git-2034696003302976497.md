        It seems he's launching something this week
      
Drake’s team has been distributing free flower bouquets in Toronto in a bid to promote a mysterious project called ‘More Life Growth Co.’
Toronto publication Narcity reported that mysterious bouquets of flowers were appearing around Drake’s home city yesterday (November 5). Some were handed out on the street by people wearing jackets emblazoned with ‘More Life’ – the title of Drake’s 2017 project – while others were sent to the offices of radio and television broadcasters.
According to breakfast show host Dina Pugliese-Mirkovich, who received a bouquet from Drake, “he’s launching a new business venture this Thursday”.
