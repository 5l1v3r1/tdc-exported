This is the third consecutive month of record-low unemployment. September’s 5.5 percent matched the record set in August.
The unemployment rate for black men hit a record low of 5.1 percent, down three-tenths from the month prior. That was lower than the previous record low of 5.2 set in December 1973.
The unemployment rate for black women was 4.8 percent, up two-tenths from September.
