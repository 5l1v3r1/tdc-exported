        Protests in Iraq started last month when people took to the streets calling for the resignation of the government, the implementation of economic reforms and the elimination of corruption. They soon turned violent, leaving dozens dead and hundreds more injured.
      
Demonstrators in Baghdad and in the south of the country calling for change to Iraq's political system blocked roads and government buildings on Sunday, which hampered road movement and the work of government agencies.
