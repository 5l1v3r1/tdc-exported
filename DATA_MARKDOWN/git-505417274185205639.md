        Irish underage international Ryan Johansson found the net twice for Bayern Munich’s U19s in their 6-0 UEFA Youth League victory over Olympiacos.
      
Johansson didn’t start the game but after coming on at half-time with Bayern 1-0 up, he found the net twice as the German side ran riot over their Greek opponents.
The 18-year-old grabbed his first goal, cutting inside from the left and striking a sweet shot past the Olympiacos goalkeeper, with his second coming from a darting run into the box to meet a cross from the right-hand side.
