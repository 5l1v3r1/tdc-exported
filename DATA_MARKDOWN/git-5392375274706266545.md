Facebook will soon require a selfie of your face from different angles to confirm your profile. The social network is testing a new identity verification method that seems to use facial recognition technology to identify fake accounts.
Facebook has nearly 2.5 billion active users worldwide and among them are many fake accounts. To fix this problem, they are testing a new identity verification method. That requires a live video of your face from different angles.
The feature was unveiled by Jane Manchun Wong, a programmer now well known for spotting features under development in the most popular applications. Yesterday, she posted a GIF on her Twitter account offering an overview of the new identity verification method. The information has since been confirmed by Facebook.
