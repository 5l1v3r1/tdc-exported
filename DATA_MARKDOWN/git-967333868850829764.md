        UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - Moscow has prepared a presidential statement regarding the security situation in Kosovo including the incident involving the arrest and beating by local police of two UN staffers and hopes the Security Council will adopt it, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said.
      
Earlier, a UN probe concluded that Kosovo's police force used excessive force when arresting two UN Mission personnel earlier this year and has found no evidence to support claims that the pair engaged in any wrongdoing before being detained.
On May 25, the so-called Kosovo police detained and injured two UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) members, including Russian citizen Mikhail Krasnoshchekov, during a raid in Serb-majority areas in northern Kosovo and Metohija.
