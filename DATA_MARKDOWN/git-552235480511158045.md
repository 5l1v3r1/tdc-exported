Paul Heckingbottom has been sacked by Hibs after a dismal run of form which has seen them win just one Premiership game this season.
The former Barnsley and Leeds United boss as appointed as Neil Lennon 's successor earlier this year, and initially had a run of good results.
Things have turned sour this season though, with just one Premiership win all season which came on the opening day against St Mirren .
Since then there has been a 6-1 defeat to Rangers, a loss in the Edinburgh derby to Hearts and, finally, a 5-2 thrashing by Celtic in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
