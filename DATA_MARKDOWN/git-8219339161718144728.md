I’ve been using the AirPods Pro for the last several days, and one thing is immediately clear: these are easily the best headphones that Apple sells, and as you’ll see in our AirPods Pro review, some of the best headphones that you can buy today.
AirPods Pro present an incredible mix of convenience, comfort, and features, making them well worth considering, even if you already own regular AirPods. Watch our hands-on AirPods Pro review for the details.
The AirPods Pro unboxing experience is similar to AirPods hardware unboxings we’ve done in the past. The big difference this time around is the inclusion of multiple ear tips, along with a Lightning to USB-C cable instead of a Lightning to USB-A cable.
Apple preinstalls the medium ear tips on the AirPods during assembly at the factory but includes a set of small and large ear tips that are able to accommodate a variety of ear canal sizes.
Along with the cable and ear tips, Apple includes some verbose documentation, along with the typical warranty and regulatory information.
