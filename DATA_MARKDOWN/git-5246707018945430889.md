Blizzcon has just kicked-off and as expected the company announced a cooperative, narrative-driven follow-up to its popular team-based hero shooter Overwatch. On top of a PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One announcement, the new entry has now also been confirmed for the Nintendo Switch.
Overwatch 2 will see players become heroes once again as they participate in four-player co-op missions that challenge them to team up, power up and stand together against an overwhelming outbreak of threats across the globe. Here's some additional info from the PR about the new Story and Hero PvE missions:
The competitive aspects of the original title will make a return as well â€“ with existing players' accomplishments and loot collections being carried across to Overwatch 2. The sequel includes the complete Overwatch roster, a new generation of heroes, new internationally recognizable maps to widen the scope of the world and a new 'Push' map type.
It's also been confirmed original Overwatch players will have access to all of the sequel's PvP content.
