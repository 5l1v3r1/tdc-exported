        A ship carrying French cognac to Tzar Nicholas II's Russia was sunk in the Baltic Sea more than 100 years ago. The cargo has now been salvaged.
      
On May 19th, 1917, at the height of World War One, Swedish steamer S/S Kyros set its course to Petrograd (today known as St Petersburg).
It was delivering 50 cases of cognac and 15 cases of liqueur from France to Russia through neutral Swedish territory.
But just off Åland island in the Baltic Sea, it was stopped and checked by German submarine UC-58, whose captain decided to sink the steamer because the alcohol was considered an illegal contraband product.
The crew were transferred to another ship and were able to return home to Sweden safely – but the cognac and liqueur was left at the bottom of the sea.
Until last month, that is.
