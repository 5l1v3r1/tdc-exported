WWE champion Brock Lesnar and Cain Velasquez went one on one in the ring on October 31 for the WWE Championship at Crown Jewel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
This would be the first time both men would face off against each other in nine years since their big fight at UFC 121 back in 2010 when Cain defeated Lesnar.
