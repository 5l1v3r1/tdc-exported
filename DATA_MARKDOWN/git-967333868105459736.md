UK MP Daniel Kawczynskis has hit out at financier George Soros after he announced that his financial contributions to a pro-Remain group called "Better for Britain" were merely meant to "educate" the British public about the pitfalls of Brexit.
Commenting on Soros’ remarks, Kawczynski accused the famous investor of harbouring disdain for the decision the UK citizens made during the Brexit referendum.
Kawczynski also remarked that Soros "has a track record of interfering," noting that the financier should probably focus on his wealth and "leave other countries to manage their own affairs."
Earlier, George Soros told The Guardian that he considers his funding of the anti-Brexit group "political philanthropy," as Britain seceding from the EU is allegedly "a process of disintegration that hurts both sides."
In March 2017, the UK government formally announced the country’s withdrawal from the EU, after over half of the voters in Britain supported the idea during the June 2016 referendum.
But while the withdrawal process was initially expected to be completed by March 2019, the deadline has since been extended twice as the withdrawal agreement is still yet to be ratified by the British parliament.
