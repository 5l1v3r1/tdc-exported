A woman smooching strangers around the globe in a set of photos has gone viral online, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase "kiss and tell."
Kristiana Kuqi, 23, posted a photo of herself on Friday kissing a man in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. To the untrained eye, the photograph appeared to show a typical couple posing in front of one of the world’s most recognizable symbols of love.
Then Kuqi revealed she didn’t know the man at all.
“I hope this guy I met at the Eiffel Tower and asked for a pic of us kissing so I could pretend I had a romantic time in Paris is doing good,” she captioned the photo, which she shared on Twitter.

Minutes later, Kuqi posted another photo of herself kissing a man in front of the Colosseum in Rome – he, too, was a complete stranger.
“I hope this one from Rome is good too,” she wrote.
In a third photo, Kuqi kisses a firefighter sitting inside of a fire truck with a similar caption: “And the fireman who responded to a fire at a wedding I was at in Kentucky. Hope he’s good too.”
