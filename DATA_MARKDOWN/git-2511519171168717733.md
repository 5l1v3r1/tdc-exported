French actor Catherine Deneuve was admitted to a hospital in Paris after a stroke, according to her family.
Newspaper Le Parisien reported on Wednesday that Deneuve, 76, had fallen ill overnight.
The actor, who became France’s leading screen actor and a top international star in the Sixties, was in a “serious state”, added the newspaper.
A family source told the French newspaper Ouest-France that Deneuve had suffered from a “very limited” transient ischemic attack (TIA), a type of stroke that happens when the blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked.
According to a statement by Deneuve’s agent quoted by Ouest-France, Deneuve’s condition is expected to be reversible.
While TIAs are sometimes referred to as “mini strokes” due to the fact that they don’t seem to cause lasting damage, they can be warning signs of a potential, more serious incident, and therefore should be treated seriously, according to the American Stroke Association.
Deneuve had been busy filming a new film titled De Son Vivant by actor and filmmaker Emmanuelle Bercot​.
