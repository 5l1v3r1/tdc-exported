Many WWE fans are calling it an NXT invasion and with good reason. From Shayna Baszler’s attack on SmackDown Women’s champion Bayley, to NXT champion Adam Cole’s win over Daniel Bryan, the blue brand was put on notice. NXT is indeed a competitive force in WWE and they’re only just getting started. But there’s also much more going on with this angle.
Longtime WWE fans were surely happy to see the black and gold brand get their day in the sun. For years, the company has promoted SmackDown and Monday Night Raw as the “main rosters” and fans have always bought in to that concept.
But times have changed now that NXT is airing live on the USA Network. The once developmental brand is now a viable third brand for Vince McMahon’s company. Instead of being used as a starting point, NXT is becoming a destination.
