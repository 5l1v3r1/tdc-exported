A married couple died on a motorcycle early this morning after colliding with a car in northeast Bangkok.
The man and woman were found dead on the sidewalk after hitting the Mazda, which lost control and plowed into a residence in Bangkok’s Khan Na Yao district, according to police.
The Mazda’s 22-year-old driver, Asawin Yeethow, told police that the motorcycle was driving the wrong way at about 5am in Soi Khu Bon 27 when it struck his vehicle, causing him to lose control and careen through a wall onto someone’s property. There were no witnesses to immediately corroborate his account.
Photos of the incident show the smashed front end of his vehicle entangled with the remains of the motorbike.
