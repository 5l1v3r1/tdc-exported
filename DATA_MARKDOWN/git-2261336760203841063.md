Invicta FC 38 comes to you from Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas tonight (November 1st)
The main event is a strawweight title bout between Kanako Murata and Emily Ducote. In the co-main, Vanessa Porto fights Karina Rodriguez in what is now a three-round non-title fight. This would’ve been for Rodriguez’s flyweight belt, but because she missed weight, she loses her title on the scale.
