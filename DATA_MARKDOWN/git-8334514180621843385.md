BEIRUT (Reuters) - The leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah called on Friday for the quick formation of a new Lebanese government that he said must hear the demands of protesters and work to restore confidence.
In a televised speech, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Prime Minister Saad al-Haririâ€™s resignation, prompted by massive protests against the ruling elite, had frozen government reform plans.
