US rapper TI has provoked outrage by revealing that he forces his 18-year-old daughter to undergo an annual "virginity test" at the gynaecologist.
The Grammy-winning musician told a podcast how he escorts Deyjah Harris to the doctor's office after each birthday to "check her hymen".
"Usually like the day after the [birthday] party, she's enjoying her gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: 'Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30'," TI, whose real name is Clifford Harris, told the presenters.
The trips began after Deyjah's 16th birthday, Harris said, and his daughter was required to sign a waiver allowing the doctor to share the "results" with him.
The episode of the Ladies Like Us podcast was released on Tuesday, but appeared to have been removed on Wednesday afternoon after it went viral on social media.
Social media users were quick to condemn Harris's behaviour, and express concern for Deyjah.
"It's extremely abusive to police your daughter's hymen and any doctor who would participate in such an act needs to lose their license," tweeted author Ijeoma Oluo.Â
