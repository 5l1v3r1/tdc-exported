The real-life Emily Dickinson was a big fan of gardening and wrote about bees a lot in her poetry, so, of course, Apple TV+’s kooky, anachronistic bio-sitcom Dickinson had to deliver the goods with a bee of its own. In the show’s third episode, Emily and her siblings throw a house party when their parents go off to Boston for a night, which gives the show an excuse to delve into all sorts of teen house-party tropes, including a rager that gets out of hand, the arrival of local mean girls, and a scene where everyone gets high (in this case, on opium). After getting high, Emily hallucinates a dance with an enormous, human-size bee, voiced by Jason Mantzoukas.
The bee, according to Dickinson creator Alena Smith, was a way to introduce the trippier elements of Dickinson’s poetry into Dickinson, and also play with some historical expectations about the period. “Living in the 1850s was a lot trippier than people realize,” Smith said, though she admits the characters reacted to opium more like today’s teens might on a drug like molly. “When we were filming that scene, I would be looking at some of the actors and be like, ‘What drug are they on?’ I don’t know!”
