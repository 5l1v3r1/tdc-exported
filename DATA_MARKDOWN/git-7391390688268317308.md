Spoilers ahead for Episode 1 of Queer Eye: We're In Japan. The first episode of Queer Eye: We're In Japan features one of the Fab Five's sweetest heroes yet: Yoko, a 58-year-old nurse who transformed her home into a hospice for the sick and elderly. Before the guys met her, she was so dedicated to her mission of providing for others that she forgot to practice self care — so much so that she didn't even have her own bed. But fans will be happy to know that since her Fab Five makeover though, Yoko says she sees herself as "a whole new Yoko."
As explained in the episode, Yoko began her journey of turning her home into a hospice — as well as building a community center, Kuma-Chan House, next door — after losing her sister to an illness. Yoko hated the thought of her sister dying in a sterile hospital without the warmth of a home, so she created spaces where people could feel a sense of companionship and belonging, and does everything from providing food and bedding to costumed entertainment for her guests. But Yoko's hard work absorbed all of her time and energy, and it took the guys much needed pep-talking and primping for her to remember that taking time for herself isn't selfish, but very necessary.
