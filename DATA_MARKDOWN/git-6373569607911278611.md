The Tesco Extra store in Roborough has been forced to close due to a leak in the roof.
Repairs are being carried out at the Woolwell Crescent store.
A Tesco spokesperson said they are hopeful the store will re-open today.
There had been reports that the store had flooded but the Tesco spokesperson said that was not the case.
They said: "This store is currently closed at the moment but they will re-open today.
"They currently do not know when the store will re-open but it will be today at some point.
"The store has not flooded. They have had a leak in the roof and they have chosen to close the store temporarily until it is fixed."
The city has been hit by a deluge of rain and strong winds since the early hours of Saturday morning.
Trees have fallen down all over Plymouth, whilst some areas of the south west have recorded winds of 100mph.
Public transport has also been disrupted across Devon and Cornwall, with both the Torpoint Ferry and Dartmouth Higher Ferry cancelling services for a brief spell.
Trains have also been delayed and restrictions were temporarily placed on Tamar Bridge , with the central lane still closed for safety reasons.
