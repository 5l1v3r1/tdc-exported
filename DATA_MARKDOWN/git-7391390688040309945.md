When a show's been on the air as long as Grey's Anatomy, it's understandable for fans to want to see members of the original cast come back for a visit every now and then. And now, thanks to a recent fan theory, there seems to be a solid chance that Addison will return to Grey's Anatomy at some point in the very near future. Portrayed by Kate Walsh, Addison first appeared on series during the Season 1 finale, revealing herself to be Derek's wife â€” a fact that came as quite a shock to Meredith, who had no idea about his marital status.
From then on, Addison became an intregal part of series and even went on to star in her very own spinoff show, Private Practice. And it's due to that connection that allows for her possible return to make total sense. Amelia Shepherd served as one of the lead characters on Private Practice alongside Addison and allowed for the two of them to grow extremely close. So now that Amelia is pregnant, many viewers are hopeful that this could easily justify a surprise pop-in from Addison, who would understandably want to check in on her friend and possibly even help with the baby's delivery.
