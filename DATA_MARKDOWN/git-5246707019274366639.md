Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa says the company has received many positive responses from Switch owners who went out and purchased Ring Fit Adventure last month. Most of the feedback is about the quality of the workout â€“ with many users supposedly claiming how they could feel the burn and were feeling quite sore the next day.
Here's exactly what Furukawa had to say:
More interestingly, was the reveal of the average age of people currently playing the exercise-driven adventure game on Switch. According to Nintendo, many of the day one buyers in Japan, Europe, and the United States are aged between "20 to 30 years old, and a lot of them are women".
In launch week, Ring Fit Adventure debuted in the top spot in the Japanese charts and third in the UK Charts. Since then, it's dropped down to second and seventh place. As for the future, Nintendo's plan is to now continue "expanding" sales of the game, so it can be enjoyed by players across the world.
