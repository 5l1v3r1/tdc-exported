Faze Jarvis, a YouTuber with nearly 2 million subscribers, has been permanently banned from playing Fortnite after uploading videos where he uses cheating software to kill enemies. Known as “aimbots,” Jarvis used the accuracy modifications to gain advantage in non-competitive modes, such solos.
The now-deleted footage that seems to have gotten Jarvis in trouble shows him never missing a shot, all while admitting he’s using cheats to do so.
