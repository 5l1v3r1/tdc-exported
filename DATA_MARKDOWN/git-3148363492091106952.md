The reporter, who covers the team for 850 ESPN Radio in Cleveland, asked Mayfield if the team’s offense lacked urgency on their failed final drive of the first half of a recent loss to New England.
“I just told you the clock was running and we had a penalty,” an agitated Mayfield told Grossi. “You want to give them the ball back? No. You don’t play, you don’t know it. That’s just plain and simple. Was I happy with the drive? No, we didn’t score points,”
Then Mayfield added, “The dumbest question you could ask. What? Jesus, Tony.”
Mayfield then left the podium, ending the press conference prematurely.
