Moreno made the appeal as he collected all reports about the city-wide cleanup operations while he was away for a three-day official visit in Korea.
The mayor arrived at the NAIA Terminal 2 at past 11 a.m. via Philippine Airlines Flight PR-467, wading his way out through crowds that wanted to have ‘selfies’ with him.
From the airport, Moreno wasted no time and went straight to his office in City Hall to attend to the huge piles of documents that needed his signature.
According to Moreno, he will duly acknowledge barangay chairpersons and barangay kagawads who put in extra efforts to help literally clean up the city.
On the other hand, for those who fail or simply do nothing, Moreno said he will never get tired of appealing for their cooperation.
‘Our job of keeping the city litter-free will definitely depend on the cooperation of its residents, specially of barangay heads so please, buong-pagpapakumbaba akong nakikiusap, magtulungan tayo,’ Moreno said.
Last week, concerned netizens reported the existence of mounds of garbage and debris in Barangay 628 in Sta. Mesa, Manila, branding it as a form of ‘sabotage.’
