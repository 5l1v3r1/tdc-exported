It has been more than a year since Kim Taehyung aka Vof BTS released his solo "Singularity" and still even today, the song continues to enchant and dazzle new viewers and is gaining more and more fans.
BTS V's solo stage during the SY: Final tour was phenomenal. It almost felt like a musical starring Kim Taehyung and his entire performance felt that way. He was so good in it that multiple reporters covering the final tour commented on his dance style and the way he was emoting the lyrics so well. It was as if a drama was unfolding on the stage!
