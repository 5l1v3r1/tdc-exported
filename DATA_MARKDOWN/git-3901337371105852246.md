In news that shocked the local football fraternity, Cape Town City announced that they had parted ways with Benni McCarthy this week. With this quickly becoming a trending topic online, have you seen some of the reactions?
Spending two successful years with the Mother City outfit, Benni led City to a Nedbank Cup triumph and a Telkom Knockout runners-up medal during his time with the club.
