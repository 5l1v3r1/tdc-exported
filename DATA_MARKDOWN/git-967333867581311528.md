        Don Junior’s new book is being marketed with a warning that it is not for those who would rather see the US fail than succeed. Among other things in the book, the US president’s son has refuted claims that his father is racist by saying that he was allowed to spend time with Michael Jackson when he was a child.
      
Donald Trump Jr. has sparked debate on Twitter over a part in his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, where he defends his father, US President Donald Trump, against claims that he is racist. One of his arguments that such accusations are false is that his dad let him hang out with Michael Jackson, who had an apartment in New York's Trump Tower.
However, this argument was interpreted differently on Twitter, as many alluded to allegations that the “King of Pop” sexually abused children, accusations that were recently rekindled by HBO’s documentary Leaving Neverland.
