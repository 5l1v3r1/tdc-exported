Viscountess Emma Weymouth has become the sixth celebrity to depart the Strictly dancefloor.
The chef and her partner Aljaz Skorjanec were given the boot after losing out in the dance-off to BBC Breakfast’s Mike Bushell and his partner Katya Jones.
Both couples performed their routines again, with all the judges opting to save Bushell and Jones for their charleston to Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines by Ron Goodwin Orchestra, over Weymouth and Skorjanec for their samba to Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber’s I Don’t Care.
