Lexus has rolled out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto across its line-up, but existing owners haven't been left in the cold.
The ES mid-sized sedan and RX SUV were the first two models to get the technology in October, while the mid-sized NX SUV, range-topping LS sedan, and the RC and LC coupe line-ups have been outfitted with the system since November 1.
Finally, all UX SUVs sold from December 1 onwards will have the technology. The BMW 3 Series-rivalling IS sedan misses out though, for now.
Owners of the following models are eligible to have the technology retrofitted to their cars â€“ it costs $249, and the work takes around an hour to complete:
The move from Lexus follows an announcement from Toyota, which last week revealed owners of some models will be able to pay $199 to have the technology retrofitted in their vehicles.
Mazda was the first to offer a retrofit for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Owners of vehicles with MZD Connect infotainment systems dating back to 2014 can pay $495 to have the software on their cars upgraded, and the hardware of their USB ports improved to support it.
