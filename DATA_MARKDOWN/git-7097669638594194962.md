A petition to save a Texas death row inmate whose case has been backed by Kim Kardashian has been signed by more than 100,000 people.
Rodney Reed was convicted of 1996 the rape and murder of Stacey Stites in 1998. Reed had had a sexual relationship with Ms Stites, but new evidence suggests that it was Ms Stites’ fiance, Jimmy Fennel, a former local police officer, who was the likely culprit.
Pressure is mounting on Governor Greg Abbott to stay the execution, scheduled for 20 November.
Over the weekend Reed’s family and supporters rallied outside of the capitol building in Austin, Texas calling for a new trial.
More than 135,000 people across the country have signed a Change.org petition asking for a stay in execution.
On October 19, Kardashian tweeted Mr Abbott, saying evidence had emerged that would exonerate Reed, adding: "I URGE YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING."
