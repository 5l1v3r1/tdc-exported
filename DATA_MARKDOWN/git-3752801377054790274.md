Amid high levels of train commuter dissatisfaction, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says his intervention mechanism, the war room, has made good progress in turning this around.
The war room was established to monitor progress and implement solutions on Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa's (Prasa) 100-day commitment to improving the service, safety and security of the rail agency as well as its capitalisation.
While attempts have been made to turn the agency around in the past three years, the 100-day commitment aims to give this process the spark it needs.
Speaking at Prasa's headquarters in Johannesburg, Mbalula painted a comprehensive picture of the progress the war room had made.
He said while vital steps have been taken to achieve its goals, it was still not enough.
"Indeed, a lot of progress has been made since the inception of the war room, but we are not where we want to be. Many challenges remain, which we continue to unlock, but I am encouraged that serious effort will be put into resolving this."
