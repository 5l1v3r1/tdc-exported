        Liverpool will play two games in the space of 24 hours in December after the EFL confirmed that the date of Carabao Cup quarter-final will not change.
      
Jurgen Kloppâ€™s team will play Aston Villa on Tuesday, December 17 at Villa Park in the EFL Cup. The following day, they will play in the Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar.
Klopp said after Liverpool beat Arsenal on penalties in the previous round of the EFL Cup that they would not play both fixtures in such a short space of time.
However, Liverpool announced on Tuesday evening that they will use two entirely different squads for the ties.
It will be the first time since December 1986 that the club have played two games in two days.
