Cape Town – From a sweet romantic comedy, and a reimaging of a classic story, to the true story of two African American entrepreneurs, and a second look at Bad Boys for Life - here are four movie trailers you might have missed.

        THE BANKER
      
Based on a true story this drama centres on revolutionary businessmen Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie) and Joe Morris (Samuel L. Jackson), who devise an audacious and risky plan to take on the racially oppressive establishment of the 1960s by helping other African Americans pursue the American dream. Along with Garrett’s wife Eunice (Nia Long), they train a working-class white man, Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to pose as the rich and privileged face of their burgeoning real estate and banking empire – while Garrett and Morris pose as a janitor and a chauffeur.
