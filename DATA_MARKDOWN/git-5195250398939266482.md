Royal Enfield dominated the retro classic segment of India until Jawa stepped into the scene last year. Jawa launched a total of two new bikes in 2018 that gave some tough competition to Royal Enfield. Recently Benelli introduced their first retro-styled motorcycle the Imperiale 400. The Imperiale 400 is the least expensive motorcycle launched by Benelli in India.
The lower price tag was achieved due to heavy localization that itself is a huge achievement for the Chinese owned Italian two-wheeler manufacturer. The Benelli Imperiale 400 is priced at Rs 1.69 Lakh (ex-showroom) and here are the few other motorcycles that you can buy with that money
The most popular offering in the Royal Enfield range is the Classic 350. The Classic 350 uses a single downtube frame while the Imperiale 400 uses a double-cradle frame. The Imperiale 400 relies on a 37mm telescopic forks at the front and twin shock absorbers at the rear while the Imperiale 400 depends on a 41 mm telescopic fork at the front and a twin shock absorbers at the rear.
The anchorage duties of the Imperiale 400 are handled by a 300 mm single disc brake at the front while the RE Classic 350 uses a 280 mm front disc brake. Both the motorcycles use a 240mm disc brake at the rear. A dual-channel ABS is offered as standard with both the motorcycles.
Powering the Imperiale 400 is a 374cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled, fuel-injected engine that produces about 21 bhp of peak power and 29 Nm of peak torque. The Classic 350 on the other hand, is powered by a 346cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled, Carbureted engine.
The unit produces about 19.8 Bhp of peak power and 28 Nm of peak torque which is comparatively lower than the Imperiale 400. The Classic 350 engine is paired with a five-speed gearbox whereas the Imperiale 400 374cc unit is coupled with a six-speed unit.
