Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday announced that Sikh pilgrims who arrive from India to visit Kartarpur will no longer need a passport to cross over into Pakistan as long as they have a valid identity.
In a tweet on Friday morning, the premier also announced that he had directed that the condition for pilgrims to register 10 days before their arrival to the Kartarpur shrine also be waived.
The prime minister further announced that the pilgrims who arrive on the day of the Kartarpur corridor's opening and on Baba Guru Nanak's 550th birth anniversary will not be charged any fee to visit.
