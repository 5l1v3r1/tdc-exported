Ansu Fati was the star attraction as Barcelona presented their youth football section at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper on Wednesday.
While Ernesto Valverde has considered him a first-team player since his debut against Real Betis, the forward didn't want to miss an emotional day for the academy. By the same token, Carles Perez was also present.
Ansu, now 17, spoke for the first time since making his debut for the first team in an interview with Bar√ßa TV.
"I've always wanted to be here," he said. "This has been my idea from the start and I hope I can spend my whole life here."
The teenager says nothing has changed since his debut: "I am calm, trying to do normal things. These (the U19s and B team players) are my teammates and will continue to be. I spend all day with them and nothing will change."
Ansu scored against Osasuna and again vs. Valencia: "Osasuna was a dream fulfilled, my first goal with the first team. And then Valencia, at Camp Nou... They were nights that I had dreamed of becoming a reality. You can't believe it."
