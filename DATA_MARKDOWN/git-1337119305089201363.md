Hulu subscribers can now download content to watch offline on their Android devices or Fire TV tablets, the streaming service announced on Twitter yesterday. The feature has arrived on Android just under a month after it came to iOS and iPadOS. In order to use the feature you’ll have to be a subscriber to Hulu’s $11.99-per-month No Ads plan rather than its cheaper $5.99 subscription.
Offline downloads have been available on competing streaming services Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for a few years now, and it’s an incredibly useful feature if you’re planning on watching a show somewhere where you know you won’t have a stable internet connection like a plane or the subway.
