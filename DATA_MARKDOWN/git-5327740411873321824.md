Gas prices in the Lower Mainland are expected to see a substantial drop Thursday, and no that’s not a joke.
Petroleum analyst Dan McTeague says prices at the pump could decrease as much as 10 cents a litre in some cities, marking the biggest single day drop in over a decade for southwestern B.C.
On Wednesday afternoon, the cheapest prices in Vancouver and Surrey were about $1.42 per litre, according to GasBuddy.com, which relies on commuter reports of local gas station prices across the country.
In Abbotsford, where pump prices don’t include a 17-cent transit tax, gas prices averaged $1.30 per litre.
