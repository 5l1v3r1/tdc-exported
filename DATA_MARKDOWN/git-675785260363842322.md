Michael Oliver will take charge of this weekend's title showdown between Liverpool and Manchester City .
The Premier League rivals will face off at Anfield on Sunday in a potentially crucial clash in the race for the title.
Liverpool are yet to taste defeat this season while champions City are in second, six points adrift of the Reds.
A win for Jurgen Klopp's side means they could go nine points clear ahead of the festive period.
The Premier League has confirmed Oliver will take charge at Anfield, with Paul Tierney named as the VAR official.
Â 
Oliver has taken charge of Liverpool twice this season - the wins over Norwich and Chelsea, and was also in the middle for City's controversial draw with Tottenham in August.
On the back of his controversial officiating in Everton's draw with Tottenham on Sunday, Martin Atkinson will be in charge of the clash between Newcastle an Bournemouth .
Atkinson was at the centre of the encounter at Goodison Park after Son Heung-min was shown red for a challenge on Andre Gomes, that led to the midfielder fracturing his ankle.
Both sides were also denied penalties by controversial VAR calls during the 1-1 draw.
