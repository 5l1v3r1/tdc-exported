Kendall Jenner's 24th birthday celebrations started Halloween night with a big costume party complete with a photo booth and A-list guest list. But on her actual birthday yesterday, Jenner did something special with a smaller group of friends and family: She went driving on a race track. Big sister Kim Kardashian shared footage on her Twitter.
"For @kendalljenner birthday yesterday went to the race track!" Kardashian wrote, sharing a photo and video in two tweets.
