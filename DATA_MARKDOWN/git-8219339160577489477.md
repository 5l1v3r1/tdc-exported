After launching its first wire-free smart doorbell back in April called View, some early August customers had “performance challenges” in certain conditions. The company pulled sales of the doorbell a couple of weeks later. Now View’s performance issues have been fixed and it’s available for sale again.
August shared the news in a blog post today:
August View offers a simple installation compared to many smart doorbells with its wire-free design. Sadly, there’s still no HomeKit support here, even though some of August’s other products include the functionality.
Notably, Netatmo is looking to release a HomeKit-enabled smart doorbell sometime before the end of the year and it may work with HomeKit Secure Video.

August View sells for $229 and is available direct from August. Learn about installation and more in the company’s FAQ page for View.
