The official trailer for Dolly Parton‘s new Netflix series has been shared online – check it out below.
Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings, which is set for release on November 22, tracks “eight Dolly stories” showcasing the “memories and inspirations” behind the country icon’s biggest hits.
Released on YouTube yesterday (November 5), the trailer for the upcoming show begins with a needle being dropped on a record player. “Songs: they’re just stories put to music,” Parton says at the top of the clip. “Songs that I’ve written, they’re stories of my life.”
The voiceover plays over a series of clips from the anthology series, which Parton appears in herself. “Jolene, will you get your pretty lil butt up here and help me sing,” she says in one scene as she speaks down the mic to a crowded bar.
