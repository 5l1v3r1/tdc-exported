Mercedes-Benz Australia has issued a recall for a handful of 2019 model-year C-Class vehicles over concerns a tie rod for the front axle may detach.
"During assembly the tie rod may have been incorrectly mounted to the right front axle stub," the German marque reports.
"If the tie rod becomes detached, the vehicle may be difficult to control, posing an accident or injury risk to the vehicle occupants or other road users."
A total of nine units are affected by this recall, sold from 1 March 2019 through 30 April 2019 â€“ the VIN list is available here.
Owners are requested to contact their preferred Mercedes-Benz dealer to arrange a free repair.
