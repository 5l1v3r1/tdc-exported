Gary Washburn offers some interesting insight into the Celtics 1st and 2nd half production.
It’s not uncommon for a team to start slowly, but what stands out to me is the Celtics’ stars are underperforming (and subsequently thriving) in unison.
Might this be proof that the guys are still learning to play effectively together? Maybe pressing early in games, or thinking too much about getting teammates involved?
I’m pulling ideas out of my a$$. But I’m willing to bet this sharp contrast by half eventually fades.
