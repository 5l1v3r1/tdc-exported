        The celebrated author has said that everything he disliked about Stanley Kubrick's iconic horror has been "redeemed" in 'Doctor Sleep'
      
Think of The Shining and your pop culture-saturated mind will no doubt vividly recall any or all of the following moments from Stanley Kubrick’s classic film: Jack Nicholson’s remarkably manic performance as Jack Torrance, those creepy twins, REDЯUM, those soaring shots of the ominous drive up to the Overlook Hotel, “Heeeere’s Johnny!“, room 237, “all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”.
Famously adapted from Stephen King’s 1977 novel, The Shining is an intense filmic experience that stays with you, and its huge influence on horror and modern cinema at large remains firmly in place nearly 40 years on from its release.
Doctor Sleep, the big-screen adaptation of King’s 2013 novel sequel to The Shining, hit cinemas last week, and you can be quite sure that writer/director Mike Flanagan will have been acutely aware of the intense pressure which comes with handling this story and the inevitable comparisons that will be made with Kubrick’s beloved 1980 film.
However well Doctor Sleep performs both critically and commercially over the next few weeks, Flanagan will at least be able to take comfort in the knowledge that King has already given the thumbs-up to this latest big screen-adaptation of his work — something that, quite amazingly, Kubrick never quite received from the celebrated author.
