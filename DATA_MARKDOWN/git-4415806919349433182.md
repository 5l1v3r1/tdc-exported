Arsene Wenger maintains he is not in discussions with Bayern Munich about their managerial vacancy – but would “never refuse” to talk to the Germans.
The 70-year-old former Arsenal boss is reported to be high on Bayern’s wanted list as they look for a replacement for Niko Kovac, who was sacked following the 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt.
The Bundesliga club are said to be looking at a deal to bring the Frenchman to the Allianz Arena until the end of the season, with former Juventus boss Max Allegri another name in the frame.
