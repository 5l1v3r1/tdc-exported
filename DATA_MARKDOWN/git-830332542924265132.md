MADISON, Wis. - The head of the University of Wisconsin System's Board of Regents has named a search committee to find candidates to replace retiring system President Ray Cross.
Regent President Andrew Petersen said Friday that board Vice President Michael Grebe will chair the committee. Other members include Petersen, regents Mike Jones, Edmund Manydeeds and Torrey Tiedeman, UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, UW-La Crosse Provost Betsy Morgan, UW-Superior Chancellor Renee Wachter and former regent Regina Millner.
The committee is expected to begin its search in December. The panel will work with a national search firm to identify and screen candidates. The full Board of Regents will make the hiring decision.
Cross has served as system president since 2014. He announced last week he'll retire after regents choose his replacement.
