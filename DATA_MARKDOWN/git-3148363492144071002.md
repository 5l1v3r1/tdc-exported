The Ipsos poll, taken in the aftermath of the Canadian federal election, showed one in three Albertans supporting the notion that their province would be better off if it separated from the rest of Canada, Global News reports.
Alberta, which voted overwhelmingly for the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and is seen as the heartland of the Canadian conservative movement, has been at odds with Mr Trudeau and the Liberals over their lack of support for the oil and gas industry, the major industry of the province, and the pushing of a “green” agenda.
The city of Fort McMurray, which is regarded as the home of the Canadian oil sands industry, has seen a particular decline under Trudeau, with customer insolvency in the city growing 39 per cent in 2018, the largest in Canada.
