        The year 2019 is coming to an end. So, it is time to mark a milestone, pause for reflection, and take stock of how bitcoin did this year versus 2018. The good news is that BTC had a remarkable recovery in 2019. And once again, the king of cryptocurrencies is outperforming the traditional asset class.
      
Bitcoin ended the year 2018 on a painful downward trend. After having reached an all-time high of $20,000 in 2017, the cryptocurrency dramatically dropped to below $3,800 at the end of 2018.
Now, the outlook for BTC appears brighter this year. Bitcoin price ended October 2019 on a pretty bullish note. By rising from a five-month low under $7,500 and returning firmly to its path toward smashing the $10,000 price mark.
To continue the story further, this year, bitcoin is significantly outperforming not only other cryptocurrencies but also key traditional assets.
Indeed, the number one cryptocurrencyâ€™s YTD performance of ~140% outshines Nasdaq 100 (28.93%), IBM (19.23%), Apple (62.8%), and oil (21.06%).
