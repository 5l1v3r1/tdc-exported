        BELGRADE (Sputnik) - Serbia hopes that negotiations with Kosovo authorities will resume in two or three months and Belgrade is ready for compromise solutions, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Monday after a meeting with US Special Representative for the Western Balkans Matthew Palmer.
      
Palmer is currently on a tour across the Balkans, during which he has already visited Pristina and held meetings with Kosovar politicians, as well as representatives of small parties of Kosovo Serbs.
Kosovo unilaterally proclaimed independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, after years of conflict with Belgrade. The self-proclaimed republic is recognised by over 100 UN member states. Serbia, as well as Russia, China, Israel, Iran, Spain, Greece and a number of other countries, have not recognised Kosovar independence.
The EU-mediated dialogue between Belgrade and Kosovo, launched in 2013, is currently stalled.
