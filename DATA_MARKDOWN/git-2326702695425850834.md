Good news gamers, as it looks like Bioware are preparing to unleash Dragon Age 4! While the company has explicitly said that, you donâ€™t have to be Sherlock freaking Holmes to work it out. They recently went onto twitter and left quite a glaring teaser for the world to see. Boy, are they gonna feel stupid if that was just a typo though.
