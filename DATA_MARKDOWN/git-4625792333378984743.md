Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy bashed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during President Trump’s rally in Louisiana on Wednesday night.
Kennedy touted Trump's economy and criticized Pelosi’s effort to impeach him.
“In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history. And do you know what our Democratic friends have done for him?” Kennedy asked. “Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him.”
While the crowd booed, Kennedy bashed the impeachment effort as “dumb.”
“I don’t mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb,” Kennedy said.
