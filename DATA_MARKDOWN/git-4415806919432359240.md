Liverpool left it late to maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the Premier League on Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp’s men were facing their first defeat of the season with three minutes remaining as they trailed to Trezeguet’s 12th-minute goal for Aston Villa.
It did not look like being Liverpool’s day – Roberto Firmino had an equaliser ruled out by VAR.
However, Andy Robertson levelled in the 87th minute, with Sadio Mane then capping an impressive comeback with the winning goal four minutes into stoppage time.
