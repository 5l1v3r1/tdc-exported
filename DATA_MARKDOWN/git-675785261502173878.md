Unai Emery made a mistake signing Nicolas Pepe in the summer instead of Harry Maguire.
That's according to Charlton boss Lee Bowyer, who reckons it would have made much more sense for the Gunners to have signed a top centre-back rather than another forward.
Arsenal signing Pepe came as a surprise this summer as the club parted with a record £75million to make the transfer happen.
The Gunners - who did not have the budget to compete with the likes of Manchester City - pulled off the transfer by agreeing to pay Lille in installments.
Maguire, meanwhile, signed for Manchester United in a deal worth £80million.
But Bowyer believes it would have made more sense Arsenal going for the centre-back, as they still look shaky at the back.
"Defensively they are frail, they concede too many goals. Their centre-halves have been a problem for years," said Bowyer on Sky Sports' The Debate.
"It's not just been this season, it's been for a while now, but they would rather spend £75million on a winger than a centre-back.
"Maguire would have been perfect for them, why didn't they get him?"
Arsenal did part with £8million to sign David Luiz from Chelsea, but the Brazilian has done little to shore things up defensively.
