        Spoilers for season 10 of 'The Walking Dead' below.
      
Episode 5 of the current tenth season of The Walking Dead aired at the weekend (November 3), and contains a very meta easter egg.
The episode, entitled What It Always Is, sees Magna listening to music on a gramophone during a scene with herself and Yumiko.
Eagle-eyed (or eared) fans have spotted that the song playing in the scene is ‘The Turtle and the Monkey’, which is written and sung by former Walking Dead star Emily Kinney, who played Beth Greene on the show. Kinney has since confirmed in a tweet that the song playing is indeed hers.
