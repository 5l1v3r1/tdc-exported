They have supported her every step of the way.
And now friends of Aileen Fraser are dancing with her every step of the way.
For the 60-year-old was given the shattering news that she had breast cancer earlier this year.
But the fighter is now into phase three of her treatment and appears to be on the mend.
Now Aileen wants to raise funds for Ayrshire Cancer Support and Irvine & Troon Cancer Care, who she says have been a tremendous support to her.
Pals at her fitness group, Glow Ayrshire, came up with the idea of rasing funds through a sponsored aerobathon in the Newton and Wallacetown Church Hall.
Karen Murrie, who runs the group, told the Post: “After Aileen was diagnosed with breast cancer we obviously wanted to help in any way we could.
“She held a raffle at her 60th birthday party and set up a JustGiving page so we decided to hold a sponsored aerobathon.
“Her total raised was a fantastic £2284.94 which is amazing.”
Aileen, of Troon, added: “I am currently going into phase three of my treatment and so far the treatment has done it’s magic.
“That’s why I decided to fundraise to give back to one of the many cancer support services that have helped me along the way.”
