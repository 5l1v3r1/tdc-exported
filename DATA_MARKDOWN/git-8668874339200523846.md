In the end, the match that no one wanted wasn’t short on its entertainment value but the pity for Wales – who were seeking a first win over the All Blacks since 1953 in Warren Gatland’s last match in charge – was that the frills mostly came from New Zealand who went on to clinch the World Cup bronze medal with a comfortable 40-17 win in Tokyo.
Despite making a multitude of changes to freshen up a Welsh XV that had a day less to recover from its semi-final defeat, Gatland’s side damagingly looked leggy for periods of this six tries to two defeat.
