Gage Halupowski, 24, pled guilty to second-degree assault with an expandable baton that left the victim, Adam Kelly, with a concussion and 25 staples in his head.
Police said they saw Halupowski collapse his weapon and hide it in his pants after he attacked the victim.
Before the assault occurred, Kelly was reportedly trying to help another man who had been injured during the protest.
Although Halupowski’s defense attorney, Edward Kroll, said Kelly did not deserve what happened to him, he added that his client made “a really terrible decision” and his sentence was one of the “harshest” he had ever seen for a young person with no criminal background.
Journalist Andy Ngo, who was also attacked during the same protests in Portland, tweeted about Halupowski’s sentencing on Friday.
