Prepare for liftoff because Harry Styles has finally announced the name, release date, and cover for his sophomore solo album, launching fans straight into orbit. According to his very succinct tweet, Fine Line will be released on December 13, hopefully with more photos like the cover art, in which Styles is flirty in fish-eye. Based on the trajectory of his hips in the photo, we’ll be floating past the moon for decades to come. Space is our home now. Fine Line arrives two years after Styles’s self-titled debut solo album. The first single, “Lights Up,” and its music video are already here for your planet-orbiting pleasure.
