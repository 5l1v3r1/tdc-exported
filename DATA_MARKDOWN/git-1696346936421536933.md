        Compromised accounts have been traced using email addresses exposed in the recent BitMEX leak. An already known email address was allegedly used to work out login credentials to gain access to less secure accounts.
      
Comments on social media suggest that the leaked email list is also being circulated on hacking forums and darknet sites. Phishing and other forms of fraud may be attempted on these accounts, as BitMEX has warned.

        “If you are concerned about your personal exposure, on BitMEX or on any other platform, the best thing you can do is to enable Two-Factor Authentication on all critical services,” warned the BitMEX letter of apology.
      
BitMEX users could get into serious trouble for using the same passwords for multiple accounts. Thus, previous leaks could make it very easy for hackers to gain entry into a new account  associated with the user. The exact measure of the problem is uncertain, though separate users complain of having their BitMEX accounts compromised.
