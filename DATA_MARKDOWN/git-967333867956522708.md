Priyanka Chopra Jonas shared a picture of her wearing a mask on Sunday and wrote in an Instagram post: “Shoot days for #thewhitetiger. It’s so hard to shoot here right now that I can’t even imagine what it must be like to live here under these conditions. We r blessed with air purifiers and masks. Pray for the homeless. Be safe everyone.”
However, her post did not go well with some netizens who started calling her out for her ‘hypocrisy’.
Many trollers took a sarcastic dig at the actress and asked her where her air pollution concerns where when she was clicked smoking cigarette during a vacation in Miami. She has previously been mocked for smoking while being the campaigner for asthma awareness in India.
