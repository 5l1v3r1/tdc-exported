The counselors at Camp Redwood may be going through a tough time on American Horror Story (what with most of them getting murdered and everything), but, as always, fans are having a fun trying to decipher how this latest installment in the series connects to past seasons. Now, another theory has come out of the woodwork that could potentially connect AHS: 1984 to Asylum in a surprisingly new way â€” and no, it's not for the reason fans might think.
Despite the different themes, Ryan Murphy has always prided himself on making various characters and storylines from former seasons intertwine with each other, creating his own shared horror universe. Already this season, there have been nods to Hotel, thanks to the return of the Night Stalker, and Asylum, thanks to Margaret's shoutout to Briarcliff Manor. However, it turns out that might not be the only way 1984 crosses over with Season 2.
As Reddit user gmanz33 noticed, Mr. Jingles' house looked eerily similar to Kit Walker's place in Asylum, which is where he lived both before and after his time at Briarcliff. In fact, if you look at the two sets side-by-side, it's easy to spot the parallels, which range from the paint color on the walls to the white double doors that divide two of the rooms.
