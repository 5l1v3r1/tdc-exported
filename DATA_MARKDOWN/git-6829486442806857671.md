The internet is going crazy over this £1.35 million house and its alarming number of wall sockets.
The totally normal-looking home is a five bedder with three bathrooms in Middlesex, Greater London which justifies the price, I guess.
The home does have some great features like a big beautiful kitchen and a back conservatory filled with natural light and windows. Beautiful!
But if you look closer at the conservatory you start to notice that something isn’t quite right in this house. Toby Davies noticed the same thing after stumbling on the property listing on Right Move. So he tweeted about the home and its sockets, and the internet went into meltdown.
