In January, illegal alien Jose Barajas-Diaz was driving drunk when he hit and killed Miguel Angel Linarte Jacome, an immigrant from Mexico. Immediately after Barajas-Diaz’s arrest, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency requested that, should he be released at any time, he be turned over to them for detainment.
In October, Barajas-Diaz was convicted for Jacome’s killing and given a five-year prison sentence, but all of it was suspended and he was given credit for time served, allowing him to be immediately released.
Rather than turning Barajas-Diaz over to ICE agents for deportation, the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office released the illegal alien into the general public and forced ICE agents to go and arrest him days later.
Acting ICE Director Matt Albence said in a statement:
As Breitbart News reported, North Carolina sanctuary jurisdictions freed more than 500 criminal illegal aliens back into the general public in Fiscal Year 2019. Up to 80 percent of criminal illegal aliens freed back into American communities by sanctuary jurisdictions go on to commit more crimes.
