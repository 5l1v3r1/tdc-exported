BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces opened fire on Wednesday to disperse protesters gathered on Baghdadâ€™s Shuhada bridge, shooting live bullets in the air, a Reuters witness said. There appeared to be no casualties.
Protesters had blocked the bridge since Tuesday afternoon as part of efforts to bring the country to a standstill, with thousands continuing to partake in anti-government protests in the capital and southern provinces.
