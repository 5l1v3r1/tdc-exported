Peyton Reed, director of Marvel Studios’ Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp has signed on for a third Ant-Man movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This is the first hint that the studio is planning a third installment for the diminutive hero, last seen in Avengers: Endgame.
Reed came to the production of Ant-Man in 2014, after the departure of director Edgar Wright. 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp was the first Marvel film that Reed developed from the beginning. The third film is likely to star Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, as well as Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer. Considering that Douglas and Pfeiffer play the Cold War-era original Ant-Man and the Wasp, I guess they could also be playing the title roles, too.
One can only hope that Michael Peña reprises his role as Scott Lang’s fast-talking business partner, Luis, too. But there is no plot information on the film just yet, nor does it have a release date. According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, “the plan is to shoot at the end of 2020 or top of 2021 for a likely release in 2022.”
