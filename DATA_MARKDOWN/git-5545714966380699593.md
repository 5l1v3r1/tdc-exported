It's update day for Dead Cells. Along with an optional "mini biome," the Corrupted Update adds an exciting "meta upgrade" – Recycling Tubes – for players who have cleared the game on BC1.
Come again? Yes, you had it right the first time. "Recycling Tubes."
"[It's a] terrible name, and that might change," according to Evil Empire's Steve Filby.
In essence, the Recycling Tubes replace the starting gear found at the Collector in hopes of cutting down on tedium and RNG struggles during the beginning of Dead Cells runs. You'll be able to pick one of four randomized item sets, each of which contains five items: melee, ranged, a shield, and two skills.
"We hope that'll make things better for players on higher levels of difficulty," he said.
