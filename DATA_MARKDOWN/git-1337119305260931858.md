On Saturday, Airbnb CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky tweeted that the company would be banning “party houses” after five people died in a shooting during a 100-plus person Halloween party at an Airbnb rental in Orinda, California.
Chesky outlines the steps Airbnb is taking in the same Twitter thread, including creating a rapid response team for “party houses”, presumably to help homeowners prevent dangerous parties.

Airbnb spokesperson Ben Breit defined “party houses” as rentals which repeatedly disturb neighbors, according to The Washington Post, but said that any specific standards have yet to be determined.
Airbnb claims it already uses an automated risk detection system that uses “predictive analytics and machine learning to instantly evaluate hundreds of signals that help us flag and investigate suspicious activity before it happens,” and Chesky says the company will have more humans screening that system soon too:
