India on Thursday defeated Bangladesh by eight wickets in a match that saw several embarrassing blunders by the Indian side in the field. Rohit Sharma played the captain’s knock in his 100th T20 International appearance and made 85 in just 41 balls. He was unlucky to have not completed his century. His half-century came in just 23 balls as he looked determined to punish the Bangladeshi bowlers. Rohit’s innings included six sixes and six boundaries.
Shikhar Dhawan provided nice support to his skipper before he got out for 31. But, by then India had almost secured their victory.
Batting first at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot, Bangladesh made a flying start as their opening batsmen scored 60 runs in just 7.1 overs. However, their innings weren’t devoid of drama as Indian fielders including skipper Rohit Sharma disappointed fans with their sloppy approach. The most embarrassing moment came when the third umpire declared Rishabh Pant’s stumping of Litton Das ‘not out.’
