        TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, is searching for answers and has been faced with extensive cleanup efforts after the Keystone pipeline system “released” 400,000 gallons of crude oil into North Dakota wetlands Tuesday night.
      
An emergency response crew was dispatched by TC Energy on October 29 after the Canada-based energy company detected a drop in pipeline pressure around 9:20 p.m. local time and shut down its portion of the Keystone pipeline system in Edinburg, North Dakota, (not to be confused with the proposed Keystone XL system).
The impacted wetlands are located less than 50 miles from the Canadian border and are not a source of residents’ drinking water, according to Karl Rockeman of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality’s water division.
