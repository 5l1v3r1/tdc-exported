Netizens are speculating whether a four-member Big Bang comeback is possible.Daesung and Taeyang are scheduled to be discharged on the 10th following G-Dragon's discharge on the 26th, but due to ongoing controversies involving the members, many netizens believe that a four member comeback will be difficult.G-Dragon was under controversy for smoking marijuana in Japan in 2011 and admitted to the allegations stating that "just smoked it thinking it was a cigarette." Before his enlistment, T.O.P was under fire for smoking marijuana in 2016 and was fined 12,000 won in July 2017 with 2-yr suspension. Daesung was under controversy after reports in July that illegal businesses were operating in his own Gangnam building that he had purchased in 2017. Daesung stated "he wasn't aware of the illegal activities when he purchased the building and will do his best and take responsibility for his part." Seungri has been the key figure in 'Burning Sun Gate' leading to him terminating his contract with YG Entertainment. He was accused of alleged embezzlement, violations of sexual violence crimes, prostitution, tax evasion, gambling and more. His case has been forwarded to prosecution.Netizens believe that due to all the allegations involving the members, it will be virtually impossible for Big Bang to comeback as four. Even if YG pushed for group activities to revive the company stock price, the public criticism will be inevitable especially after T.O.P's reply to a netizen on SNS in October stating "that he will not be coming back."Many believe that its highly likely the members will resume activities solo or in a unit.
