A reality TV star has been charged with 'extorting and assaulting' her Tinder date after luring him into a home.
Suzi Taylor, 49, was refused bail for holding the man against his will in a property in Brisbane, Australia, reports say.
She demanded the victim hand over money after he arrived at the home shortly after midnight on Wednesday, a court heard.
When he refused to give her any cash, another man reportedly walked into the room and attacked him.
Â 
She is also said to have assaulted her date, allegedly kicking his body and punching him in the face for a minute.
Taylor and 22-year-old Ali Ebrahimi have reportedly been charged with extortion, deprivation of liberty, assault and drug possession.
The pair stand accused of forcing the man to transfer funds online, before stealing his bank card and withdrawing cash.
The TV star was denied bail due to her risk of re-offending, according to 9News .
Her lawyer told the court that Ebrahimi was the main offender.
In 2015, Taylor appeared on the Australian reality show The Block, a show in which contestants compete to renovate homes and sell them on.
