One week after an alleged altercation in Texas led to his arrest, Jared Padalecki issued his first public statement, apologizing to Supernatural fans for missing an event at DC Con in Washington D.C. On Twitter, Padalecki wrote, in part, "I want to sincerely thank my family and friends for all of your love and support." On Sunday, Padalecki's co-stars Alexander Calvert and Jake Abel stepped in for the panel in his place alongside castmate Jensen Ackles, according to E! News. (Bustle reached out to Padalecki's manager and lawyers for further comment on his tweet and his arrest, but did not receive an immediate response.)
On Oct. 27, Padalecki allegedly struck a bartender outside of the Stereotype Bar in Austin, Texas and allegedly put another club employee in a headlock, according to TMZ. The Travis County Clerk's Office apprehended and charged Padalecki with two counts of assault causing bodily injury, as well as one count of public intoxication, Entertainment Weekly reported. Padalecki was released on bond later the same day, a rep from the clerk's office confirmed to EW.
