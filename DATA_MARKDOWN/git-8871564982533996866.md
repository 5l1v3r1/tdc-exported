While app-based motorcycle taxi drivers (locally known as ojek online or ojol for short) have brought convenience to the lives of many Indonesians through the wide array of services they offer, it’s easy to overlook the amount of hard work they have to put in to their jobs — for relatively low pay.
A video that has been making the rounds on social media has shone a light on the harsh and competitive nature of making a living as an ojol. In it, a driver named Darto, believed to be from Cilincing, North Jakarta, was filmed bawling for several minutes after it appeared that his customer just canceled on him.
