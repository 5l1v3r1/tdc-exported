REUTERS: Saracens' representatives have pulled out of Wednesday's season launch of the Champions Cup in Cardiff, prompting European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to consider taking action against the English Premiership club.
European and English champions Saracens were docked 35 points and fined Â£5.36 million by the Premiership on Tuesday after being found guilty of breaching salary cap regulations.
"EPCR is disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019/20 Season Launch of the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup in Cardiff," Champions Cup organisers EPCR said in a statement.
"EPCR will now consider what action is appropriate in this instance and will be making no further comment at this time."
Saracens said on Tuesday they were "shocked and disappointed" with the sanctions imposed by the English Premiership and will appeal against the punishment.
The club will begin their European title defence against Racing 92 in Pool 4 on Nov. 17.
