Having multiple villains can sometimes hurt a superhero movie, but The Batman is taking its chances with three different rogues. Yesterday brought word that Colin Farrell was in talks to play the Penguin in Matt Reeves’ upcoming reboot. If Farrell signs on, he’ll menace Robert Pattinson’s Batman alongside Paul Dano’s Riddler and Zoe Kravitz’s Catwoman. However, a new development suggests that the film could re-introduce yet another one of the Dark Knight’s most famous enemies.
After it was announced that Farrell and Andy Serkis had begun negotiations to appear in The Batman as Penguin and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively, Variety’s Justin Kroll dropped one more bombshell on fans. Via Twitter, he shared that Warner Bros. was circling an actor from HBO’s Succession to star as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Unfortunately, the then-unnamed actor decided to pass on the role. You can check out his tweet for yourself below.
