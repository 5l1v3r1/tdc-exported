Tens of thousands of Islamists along with opposition supporters have been rallying in Pakistan's capital Islamabad to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan over the country's economic crisis.
The so-called “Freedom March” is being held as Islamabad authorities use shipping containers and riot police to block access to the "Red Zone” which is home to parliament, the Supreme Court and the Prime Minister's residence.
The rally, which kicked off as a caravan of cars and buses from the southern city of Karachi last Sunday, is led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, head of one of the country's largest Islamist parties - the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI).
