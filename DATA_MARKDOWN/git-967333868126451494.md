        The UK government introduced an immediate ban on fracking across England in the wake of recent seismic events related to fracking activities at Preston New Road in Lancashire, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said on Saturday.
      
Preston New Road is a fracking site that became high profile after hydraulic fracturing activities there caused seismic events back in 2018.
Last August, fracking firm Cuadrilla suspended its activities there after they caused a 2.9 magnitude earthquake.
According to the British Geological Survey, fracking at Preston New Road caused around 50 very small seismic events in 2018, while over 120 seismic events were detected there in August.
