For a small period, 80 Days was one of those mobile games that completely dominated my social feed. It was a neat rework of the Jules Verne novel with just enough fun mechanics, branching stories and plenty of style to carry the day.
Wanderlust Travel Stories, which launched on Steam earlier this year and is now available on iOS and MacOS, follows a similar path. You start with a small group of travellers who meet up and share their stories from around the world. How those stories play out? Well, that's where you come in.
Wanderlust is officially described as a "Slow Game", but the best way to think about it is more like an interactive slice of life visual novel. The first part plays out like a normal story with some chilled music, with sounds of the beach, birds or whatever pertains to the scene at hand weaved throughout.
