While family, friends and fans hailed the “Shahenshah” (King) of Bollywood on hitting the golden anniversary milestone, the 77-year-old actor revealed that doctors have asked him to take rest for a while.
In his latest blog-post, Amitabh noted that his doctors who he referred to as the “stethoscope dressed messengers from heaven” have given “strong warnings to cut back on work" as the actor still juggles multiple film and television projects. 
Earlier in October, hell broke loose when Amitabh was admitted to hospital for three days in western Mumbai. Speculations made the rounds then suggesting that the veteran actor was getting treated for some liver ailment.
However, lightning up the mood, Amitabh’s son – actor Abhishek Bachchan took to Twitter and expressed pride and delight on his father’s big day.
