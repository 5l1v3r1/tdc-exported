It’s one of the most popular film and TV streaming services around, but it seems that Amazon Prime Video has crashed this morning.
According to DownDetector the issues started at 09:16 GMT, and are affecting users across the UK.
While the reason for the outage remains unclear, of those who reported issues, 85% said they were having problems streaming videos, 12% couldn’t log-in, and 2% were having problems with the website.
We tested the app, and was met by a spinning wheel of the home page, and couldn’t access any downloaded content.
Mirror Online has contacted Amazon for comment.
