        The recently announced Diablo IV is set to be an online exclusive, requiring a constant internet connection at all times, regardless of which game mode you choose to play.
      
A Blizzard representative confirmed to GameSpot that every version of Diablo 4 will be online-only, regardless of whether you’re on PC, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One.
That means that even if you want to tackle the entire game solo and never interact with any other players, you’ll still require a constant internet connection in order to play.
It’s not currently known whether the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game will require PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold to play, or whether players will be able to get away with just having a stable internet connection.
Diablo IV was officially announced during BlizzCon 2019. The announcement came accompanied by a gory cinematic, which you can watch below.
