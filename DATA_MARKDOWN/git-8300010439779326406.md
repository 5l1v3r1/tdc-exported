LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Nearly a week after Los Angeles International Airport debuted its shuttle and ride-share pickup system, passengers continue to voice frustration at long wait times.Long lines formed at the LAX-it lot as visitors waited for taxis and ride-share vehicles on a busy Sunday night."As we hit peak Sunday travel times, we are seeing increased passenger demand for ride apps tonight. Please be aware of longer wait times up to one hour currently as some ride apps may not have cars immediately available," the airport said on social media.
