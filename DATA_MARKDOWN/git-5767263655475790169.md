No matter how talented an actor is, certain roles require a little push from the hair and make-up department. With the right wig, mask, or bodysuit some characters can really come alive on screen. But, sometimes the transformation is so huge, you don’t realize who the actor is or what they actually look like.
Bright Side put together a collection of photos of some of the best and most surprising makeup and prosthetics work on screen. Be ready to be amazed!
Which transformation was your favorite? Do you know of any others that also deserve recognition? Come talk to us in the comments!
