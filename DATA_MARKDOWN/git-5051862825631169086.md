While you sleep, cerebrospinal fluid flows through your brain in rhythmic, pulsing waves, researchers report.
The research shows that when you’re asleep, your neurons go quiet and, a few seconds later, blood flows out of your head. Then, a watery liquid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows in, washing through your brain.
The study is the first to illustrate that the brain’s CSF pulses during sleep, and that these motions are closely tied with brain wave activity and blood flow.
