At the Storage Developer Conference back in 2018, Microsoft Research presented a new research paper that discussed about how data can be stored in a glass using laser light. At Ignite conference today, Microsoft and Warner Bros. demoed a proof of concept representing this next generation of storage. Microsoft and Warner Bros. has stored the entire classic Superman movie on a 75 x 75 x 2 mm thick piece of glass. This is a great milestone for Microsoft Research.
For the media and entertainment industry, film is still the current long-term storage solutionâ€”not digital. Glass storage provides a viable, virtually indestructible, and truly long-term storage solution, and Microsoft is eager to be pursuing this new technology as a cloud provider.
