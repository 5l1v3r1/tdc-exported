On Saturday night, Furkan Korkmaz probably hit the biggest shot of his entire life.
He hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 0.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter, lifting the Sixers to a one-point victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.
Korkmaz getting the opportunity to take the last shot was an interesting move, especially with his inconsistent play on both sides of the court throughout his young NBA career.
