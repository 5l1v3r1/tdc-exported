If you need one pure thing to cling to today, let it be that two sweet season-six Great British Bake Off (or Great British Baking Show here in the U.S.) contestants might be dating. Yes, Michael Chakraverty and Henry Bird, who both competed this year on the world’s most palliative reality show, are possibly now a couple. The rumors come from social media, naturally, after the bakers’ co-star, Alice Fevronia, a geography teacher with very nice hair, posted a photo on her stories of the two of them looking cozy with the caption “BAE-ke Off.”
