        As the UK kicks-off its snap 2019 snap General Election for the 12 December, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has claimed it will formally request the right to hold a second referendum on independence in 2020 before the end of this year.
      
Nicola Sturgeon announced on Friday that she will demand the power from Westminster to hold another Scottish independence referendum within days of the election result, and that current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would permit one if he were to become Prime Minister.
During an election rally in Leith, the Scottish National leader urged Scots to "demonstrate the desire" for independence by voting for her party.
