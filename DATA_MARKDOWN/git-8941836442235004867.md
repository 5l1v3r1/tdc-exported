RENO, Nev. (AP) - Sheriff deputies found no explosives after a bomb scare in downtown Reno forced the evacuation of two courthouses and shut down several streets for nearly two hours.
Authorities evacuated and closed the Washoe County District Court and the Reno Justice Court across the street in the Mills B. Lane Justice Center following a bomb threat Wednesday afternoon.
The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office said it determined there was no danger after a search that included bomb-sniffing dogs “revealed no evidence to support a threat.”
Most streets reopened by 5 p.m. in the neighboring blocks where traffic was clogged near the Truckee River on the south edge of the main downtown casino district. The courthouses remained closed for the day.
