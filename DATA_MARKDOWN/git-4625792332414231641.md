The Ukraine whistleblower’s attorney Mark Zaid has been warning President Trump of a pending coup since 2017.
Zaid has been a critic of the president long before he was hired to represent the whistleblower that triggered the House impeachment proceeding.
In 2017, Zaid tweeted that Trump was facing a “rebellion” that would eventually lead to impeachment.
