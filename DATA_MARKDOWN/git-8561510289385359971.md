        Do you have two left feet, but wish that, just once, you could bust some moves — or at least look like you can?
      
Good news: There’s now an AI for that, and it needs just one full body photo to make you look like the next Beyoncé.
The AI is the work of NVIDIA’s research team. They recently published a paper on the tech on the pre-print server arXiv, and they’ve pledged to release the code as soon as lawyers “resolve some legal issues.”
In addition to working on people, the AI can make sculptures look like they’re dancing their asses off, too. It can also be applied to just faces, making a person look like they’re saying something they didn’t. And if that wasn’t enough, it can also take an image of any city and output a video of a car seemingly driving down its streets.
