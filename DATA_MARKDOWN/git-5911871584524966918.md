There’s something almost anti-glamorous about the way Wilco handle late-night TV performances. Other artists treat televised performances as make-or-break events, and they do everything they can to make an impression. Wilco roll up, rumpled and bedraggled, play some pretty music, and bounce This isn’t new for them.
Last month, Wilco released their newest album Ode To Joy. And last night, they were the musical guests on Late Night With Seth Meyers. On Seth Meyers, Wilco played the stately single “Love Is Everywhere (Beware).” They sounded lovely. And they looked the same as they did when they were on Colbert last month. Jeff Tweedy may even have been wearing the exact same thing. Watch it below.
