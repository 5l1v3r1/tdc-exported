Ernesto Valverde has taken the criticism about Barcelona's defeat by Levante on the chin. Here are his key quotes ahead of the clash with Slavia Prague.
Pressure: It’s clear that when you lose you’re under more pressure, we know what it means to lose at this club. A lot of fuss is always generated and I think that for us that’s good because it obliges you to react.
Performance: We always feel obligated (to perform) because they even generate fuss when you win and you haven’t had a great game. We usually react well and I expect the same tomorrow.
Slavia: I imagine a similar game to the first leg or the one they played away at Inter. They maintain their identity wherever they play. They nearly beat Inter and had good games against Borussia and us. Lots of physicality and arrivals into the box.
Personal: The coach is responsible for the team, the group, when they lose they look at the coach and I take that. In their first two chances they scored. We weren't playing well in attack, we didn't have enough of the ball to stop that.
Dembele: Everyone wants a place, they play to stay in it. The same for Ansu, Luis, Griezmann, Pique. Dembele, when he gets the chance, will have to take it and stop anyone taking his place.
