Spoilers ahead for Episode 2 of Queer Eye: We're In Japan. For their latest round of hero makeovers, Queer Eye's Fab Five flew to Japan, where they met Kan, a young cosmetics marketer who adores Beyoncé, but lacked the same comfort in his own skin. He and his boyfriend Tom were in a long-distance, long-term relationship (or "LDLTR," as Jonathan called it), and the guys visited just in time to give him the confidence to introduce Tom to his family for the first time. The meeting went well, and viewers will be happy to know that Kan and Tom are still together.
As explained in the episode, Kan earned his master's and bachelor's degrees abroad in Vancouver and London, where he met Tom. He told the Fab Five that he could more freely express his individuality there because the cultures were more accepting, but Jonathan, Karamo, Antoni, Tan, and Bobby assured him that in order for him to live authentically 100% of the time, the acceptance had to come from within.
By the time each of the guys spent quality time with Kan and introduced him to LGBTQ members of his local community, Kan held his head high and wore a confident smile — one that hid behind a slouched expression when the Fab Five first stepped into his tiny apartment.
