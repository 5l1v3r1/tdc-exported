The current financial system as we know it is broken. If everything was ticking along as it should the central banks of the world wouldn’t have to start helping the private banks which have been acting with impunity with other people’s money. Bitcoin again is shaping up to be the answer, especially where the future of fiat is concerned.
A recent report by Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, explores the failings of the current financial system. Lenders are handing out money without consequence because they have a lot of it to give. This is largely because central banks are pushing it on to them and buying financial assets in their futile attempts to push economic activity and inflation up.
Dalio adds that prices of financial assets have increased but future expected returns have fallen as economic growth and inflation remains sluggish. Companies can sell dreams without clear profit plans because investors are flush with borrowed money. The system is clearly flawed.
