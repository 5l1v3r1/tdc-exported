England and South Africa played out a nervy first half in the Rugby World Cup final in Japan.
The Springboks went in 12-6 up at the break courtesy of four penalties from Handre Pollard, while Owen Farrell replied with a pair of his own for the Red Rose.
Eddie Jones's men have it all to do if they are to emulate England's 2003 success.
Rules dictate that if the two countries cannot be separated after 80 minutes, there will be extra-time, sudden death and then a kicking competition.
Each team would have to nominate five kickers, from those still on the field, each of whom would have one shot each to kick a goal from one of three spots.
If the scores were still level after five kicks it would then go to sudden death.
England were dealt an early blow when tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler was knocked out cold while attempting a tackle.
The 26-year-old was trying to stop South Africa winger Makazole Mapimpi in his tracks, but made contact with team mate Maro Itoje's shoulder and fell to the ground instead, with referee Jerome Garces immediately calling a halt to play.
After medical treatment he managed to walk off the field, with Dan Cole has replacing him.
