KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): RHB Retail Research said SKP Resources Bhd may rebound further after it tested the RM1.24 support in its latest session.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said given that it has formed a positive candle for the second consecutive session, the positive sentiment has been enhanced.
“A positive bias may emerge above the RM1.27 level, with an exit set below the RM1.24 threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at RM1.39. This is followed by the RM1.47 level,” it said.
