Park officials announced a historic, abandoned barge that was nestled above Niagara Falls shifted its position and moved, before getting stuck again.
"The severe weather conditions experienced yesterday have caused the iron scow, which has remained lodged in the powerful upper rapids above the Falls for over a century, to shift significantly from its position," the park officials said Friday on their Twitter account.
