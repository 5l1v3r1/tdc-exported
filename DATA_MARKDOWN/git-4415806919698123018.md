The Green Party has become the latest in Northern Ireland to announce that it will stand aside in a constituency to back another party’s candidate in the UK General Election.
The Greens’ South Belfast MLA Clare Bailey said she will not be a candidate in the December 12 poll, and instead urged her supporters to back the SDLP’s Claire Hanna.
South Belfast is expected to be a close race between Ms Hanna and DUP incumbent Emma Little-Pengelly.
