Most gamers, PC-focused or otherwise, have heard of legendary game designer Hideo Kojima. Kojima is responsible for not only the much-loved (and, at times, completely bonkers) Metal Gear franchise but also the recently-launched "Death Stranding."
While Death Stranding is, in many ways, an entirely different beast than the Metal Gear games (and not just because the former was developed after Kojima split from Konami), they both share a few key similarities; primarily in the realm of cinematic storytelling.
Anyone who has played a Kojima game knows that the man is fascinated with lengthy, movie-like cutscenes filled to the brim with interesting characters, dialogue, and camera angles, and Death Stranding (as well as the Metal Gear series) has all of that in droves.
If you are familiar with these games, then it probably won't come as much of a surprise to hear that Kojima reportedly intends to venture into the realm of filmmaking someday.
