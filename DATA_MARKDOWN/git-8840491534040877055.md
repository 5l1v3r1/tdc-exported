THE Mayo GAA County Board has called an emergency meeting for tomorrow night.
It follows statements issued by seven clubs yesterday which challenged the reported vote of confidence taken in the officers of the board at last Monday's behind-clased-doors meeting of the organisation.
Charlestown Sarsfields, Castlebar Mitchels, Larardane MacHales, Burrishoole, Ardnaree, Ballycastle and Louisburgh questioned the press release by the board which highlighted the 'resounding vote of confidence'.
In a communication to clubs last night, Mayo secretary Dermot Butler appealed to clubs to desist from using social media to express their views.
He said the proper forum is to go through their respective club secretaries.
The Connaught Telegraph has learned the board is investigating reports that last Monday's meeting was allegedly recorded by a person in attendance and is being circulated.
