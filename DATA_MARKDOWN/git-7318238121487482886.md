French volunteer search teams have found fragments from an engine that exploded in mid-air over eastern France in July, officials have said.
The discovery came in an unprecedented search operation involving 150 members of the public after French air accident investigation agency BEA asked volunteers to help comb a forest for a titanium engine part following two engine explosions on Airbus A220 jets operated by the airline Swiss since July.
A third engine suffered a similar blowout last month, forcing it to divert to Paris where it scattered some parts during landing, according to French officials.
"Three fragments from the engine have been found by the ... volunteer team ... Thanks to all participants of this first day," BEA said on its Twitter account.
