Milwaukee Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe apparently had a brain lapse in the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night.
Bledsoe was set to inbound the ball with about 10 minutes left in the game to Giannis Antetokounmpo from the sideline when he decided to dribble the ball upon receiving it from the referee. He was immediately called for a violation and the ball was given back to the Clippers.
