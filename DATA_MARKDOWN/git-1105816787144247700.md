SYRIA: The United States (US) has started the construction of two new military bases in Syria’s oil-rich Deir Ez-Zor governorate.
The military bases are being built in the 113th Brigade area and near al-Sur region, according to local sources.
While the footage captured by Anadolu Agency showed that many construction equipment is put into action, it was learnt the US has sent 250 to 300 additional soldiers, armored vehicles, heavy weapons and ammunition to the region.
After a pause in Turkey’s anti-terror operation in northern Syria, US troops on Friday resumed military patrols around oil reservoirs in northeastern Syria.
Turkey on Oct 9 launched Operation Peace Spring to eliminate YPG/PKK terrorists from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.
On Oct 22, Turkey reached an agreement with Russia to force YPG/PKK terrorists to withdraw from the planned terror-free zone with their weapons.
