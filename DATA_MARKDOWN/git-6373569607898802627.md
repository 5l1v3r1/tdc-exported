Uneaten food from Plymouth Argyle’s postponed game against Grimsby Town at Home Park did not go to waste as it was donated to two groups who look after the homeless.
It was given to the George House Homeless Hostel in Stonehouse and the Salvation Army’s Devonport House.
The food had either already been ordered, cooked and/or heated when the League Two fixture was called off at around 12.30pm on Saturday.
With a crowd of approaching 9,000 hungry fans expected for the match there was a lot of it.
So some of it that could still be eaten - pasties, pies and slices - was distributed to the George House Homeless Hostel and Devonport House.
Argyle’s stadium catering manager Andrew Bradford made the food drop-offs.
The game against Grimsby was postponed because of safety concerns after part of the Barn Park End roof at Home Park was damaged by overnight gales which battered the city.
Argyle issued a statement to announce the game had been called off.
It read: "Severe winds overnight have caused significant damage to the roof of Home Park, rendering parts of the ground unsafe for spectators.
