THE FAKE A message claiming that the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is granting Rs 80,000 to its employees who worked between 1990 and 2018 is being circulated on social media. SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH? A fact check conducted by The Quint discovered that the same message went viral in 2018. A notification on the official EPFO website has warned the public against such messages.
