MDC vice president Tendai Biti says Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube requires a mental examination following his remarks that he will be able to pay civil servants’ annual bonus “thanks to austerity measures”.
In an interview with NewsDay, Biti maintained that giving civil servants bonuses will not alleviate their suffering as they are already being paid “nothing”. He said:
Minister Ncube made the announcement on Twitter where he seemed to credit austerity measures for the government’s ability to pay its workers a 13th cheque.
