        In the latest salvo in the ongoing saga surrounding Bitmain, ousted co-founder Micree Zhan is threatening to fight back claiming to have been betrayed by his partners. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin mining giant is moving ahead with plans to launch a U.S. IPO.
      
Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive and Chinese crypto news insider published a series of tweets on Thursday (November 7, 2019), detailing the latest developments in the Bitmain leadership saga.
As previously reported by BTCManager, Jihan Wu had taken over at Bitmain in a management upheaval that saw the dismissal of fellow co-founder Micree Zhan. Now, Zhan has come out in an open letter to present his side of the story.
