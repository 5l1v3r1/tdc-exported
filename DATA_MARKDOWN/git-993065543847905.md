THE US House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee has unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement.
The resolution, which calls for strict adherence to the Good Friday Agreement during Brexit negotiations, will now advance to the full house for a vote at a future date.
It also urges the UK and European Union to ensure that Brexit does not threaten peace on the island of Ireland and opposes reintroducing a hard border.
A similar resolution opposing the return of a hard border was introduced in the US House of Representatives in January.
Some senior members of the US Congress have previously warned that they will oppose any US-UK trade deal that undermines the Good Friday Agreement.
