During Masahiro Sakurai's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Terry Bogard demonstration video yesterday, it was revealed a new in-game tournament event would be starting this Friday. Of course, this is all to celebrate the SNK character's recent release.
This special event, titled "The Road to Becoming Fighting King" starts on 8th November and will run for a total of three days. During this event, you'll have to take on various other fighters in one-on-one stamina battles across Omega Form stages.
As you can see above, you'll encounter fighters like Ryu from the Street Fighter series, Little Mac from the Punch-Out!! series and the Terry Bogard version of the pink puffball, Kirby. Will you be booting up Smash Bros. this weekend to participate in this all-star fighting tournament? Comment down below.
