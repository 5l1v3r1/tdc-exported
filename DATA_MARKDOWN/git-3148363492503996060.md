A reporter for the College Fix attended a Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) rally at the University of Minnesota on Sunday to ask leftist college students if they could name a Democratic accomplishment from the past three years.
Most of the students were unable to name a single accomplishment.
