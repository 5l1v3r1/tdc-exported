        American fast food company McDonald’s has apologized for its “Sundae Bloody Sundae” ad used in several cities in Portugal to promote a Halloween-themed dessert, claiming it didn’t mean to cause “any offense or distress.”
      
Bloody Sunday, also referred to as the Bogside Massacre, took place on January 30, 1972, in Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians protesting against internment. A total of 14 people died.
