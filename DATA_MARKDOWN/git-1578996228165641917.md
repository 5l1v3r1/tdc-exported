Selena Gomez hit a major milestone today: For the first time ever in her career, Gomez has the #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Gomez's intimate breakup ballad, "Lose You to Love Me," got the honor last week, during its first full week of streaming. It is also #1 on the Rolling Stone 100. Gomez commented on a fan's post in disbelief of the double-chart news. "Wait is that real?! Lol," she wrote. Yes, it's real.
Gomez posted four Instagram Stories marking the Hot 100 achievement and showcasing her sheer shock. "WHAT?! Omg!! Thank you so much @billboardcharts for a first for me. I'm so grateful!" she wrote on her first Instagram Story, a repost of the article screenshot song co-writer Julia Michaels shared.
"Thank you guys for streaming and committing to this song!" Gomez continued in a second Instagram Story. "It means the world to me! This song has my whole heart."
In a third Instagram Story, Gomez just posted a screenshot of the headline with blue heart emojis and a crying face emoji. Her fourth Instagram Story was her cousin's students congratulating her on the honor.
