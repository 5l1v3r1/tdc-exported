The Rania fandom is buzzing at the possibility of another member being added to the group. Her Instagram is @flaylas and she was seen in a photo with Rania members Namfon and Larissa. It is just as a rumor right now as no one knows if she is an official member or not.
What do you think of this? Should DR Music stop adding members to Rania?
