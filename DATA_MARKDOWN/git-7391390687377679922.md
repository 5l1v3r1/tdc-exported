As reported by multiple outlets, Chrissy Teigen's parents are getting divorced. According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, the cookbook author's dad Ronald Teigen reportedly filed for a dissolution of marriage in Los Angeles on Tuesday against his wife Vilailuck Teigen, also known as Pepper. (Bustle reached out to Chrissy's rep for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.)
It's unclear how long the couple was actually married for, but Ronald cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for their split, per Us Weekly. In addition to Chrissy, the pair also has a daughter named Tina, who Pepper had from a previous relationship before marrying Ronald.
Chrissy hasn't publicly commented on the divorce reports yet, but according to a tweet from journalist Karen Valby, who wrote Chrissy and John Legend's recent Vanity Fair cover story, the Lip Sync Battle star made light of her parents' split before the news broke, joking that she would now get to have "two Christmases." The reporter also described Ronald and Pepper's marriage as something that had long been "more of a friendship ... coming to an end."
