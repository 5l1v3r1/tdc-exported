LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- A proposal to rezone thousands of acres for lime rock mining in Lee County did not pass Wednesday.
County commissioners voted 5-0 in favor of the hearing examiner's recommendation against the rezone.
The proposed area was off of Corkscrew Road and State Road 82. It's a little over 4200 acres.
Several people showed up to the hearing wearing red to show their objection to the rezone. Those people were concerned about pollution, environmental degradation, and traffic dangers from mining trucks.
