        Mario Kart Tour, the mobile game spinoff of the Mario Kart series, is officially getting a multiplayer beta in December 2019. The catch? It’s paywalled.
      
As the official Mario Kart Tour Twitter confirmed, only those who have subscribed to the Mario Kart Tour Gold Pass will be allowed to access the real-time multiplayer beta test.
