Crystal Palace target Scott Banks has knocked back a new deal and told Dundee United he will leave on freedom of contract.
The 18-year-old winger has played four times after a loan spell at Clyde last season.
United will be due around £200,000 in training compensation with Banks now likely to move south at the end of the season.
Meanwhile, Robbie Neilson has accused Hearts of being short-sighted after they axed Craig Levein.
The Tynecastle outfit fired the 55-year-old as manager and director of football last week.
Dundee United boss Neilson, head coach at Jambos under Levein, said: “I’m disappointed for Craig. Look at what he’s done for the long term, taking the club from post administration, back to the Premiership, putting the youth academy in place, building structures.
“It’s short-termism to move him.
“Craig will probably take a little while to reflect, get the energy levels back up again but he will be back in football, no doubt.”
