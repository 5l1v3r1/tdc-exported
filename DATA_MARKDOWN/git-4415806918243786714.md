British businessman Richard Branson has paid tribute to "incredible entertainer" Gay Byrne, who passed away on Monday.
Branson, who was interviewed by Byrne on both the Late Late Show and The Meaning of Life, said the broadcaster helped to shape modern Ireland.
"Everybody in Ireland watched Gay on The Late Late Show on a Friday night," he said.
