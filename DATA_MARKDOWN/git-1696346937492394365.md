        With a leak of at least 23,000 emails, the recent BitMEX email leak was much heavier than expected. An inadvertent message that included lists of emails made the rounds last week, creating a security break for the largest crypto derivatives exchange.
      
Details of the BitMEX email leak were shared a few hours ago by well-known industry researcher Larry Cermak in one of his tweets. Using BitMEX is not entirely illegal, though it has been banned for US citizens.
BitMEX’s, perpetual BTC/USDT swap, is the most active contract linked to Bitcoin (BTC) trades. The exchange, however, operates in a legal gray area, and the leaked emails may point to breaks in excluding some regions. Trading on BitMex has also been seen as highly risky, akin to gambling.
