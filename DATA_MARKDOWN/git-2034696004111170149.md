        A NEW FRANK OCEAN DAY IS UPON US
      
Frank Ocean has released a surprise new track, ‘In My Room’, via Apple Music.
The new song, which is currently not available on any other formats, showcases the artist’s rapping abilities across just over two minutes, as well as some typically emotional lyrics. “I guess I can’t state my feelings too soon, I don’t know you,” Ocean sings on the track.
The new material follows recent single ‘DHL’, released October 20, as well as an untitled Skepta collaboration. Yesterday (November 1), Frank Ocean debuted the unreleased collaboration at one of his PrEP+ parties last night – see a clip of it below.
