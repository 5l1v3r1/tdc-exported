        After US President Donald Trump showed a dog which took part in a special military operation against Daesh* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to the world on Monday, the prices on the breed of military dogs, named Belgian Malinois, really hiked.
      
The dog, whose name, according to the US President, is Conan, was injured in the US raid against the Daesh leader. On Wednesday Trump tweeted a doctored image of himself giving Conan, the Belgian Malinois, a medal for its service. The US president's tweet has sparked a new wave of attention to the breed of dog.
