A man narrowly avoided prison after admitting a drug supply charge.
Stewart Tannock, 29, was instead ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid community work – the maximum available – when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
Tannock admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis in Ross Drive, Viewpark, and at his home in Pinmore Place, Glasgow, on February 21.
He was given six months to complete the work order.
