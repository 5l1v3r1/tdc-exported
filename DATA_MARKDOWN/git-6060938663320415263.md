NEW DELHI: Team India captain Virat Kohli turned 31 on Tuesday.
Kohli, who made his international debut in August 2008 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in Dambulla, has played 82 Tests, 239 ODIs and 72 T20Is in his career so far.
With 11520 ODI runs in 239 matches (230 innings), Kohli is the second Indian after batting legend Sachin Tendulkar with most runs.
He also has 43 ODI centuries under his belt, second most in the world. Tendulkar tops the list with 49 ODI tons.
In October last year, Kohli became the fastest batsman to score 10,000 ODI runs.
Kohli, on his birthday, took to Twitter and shared an emotional post about a note that he has written to a 15-year-old Kohli.
