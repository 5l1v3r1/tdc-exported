A white California high school teacher showed up for classes in blackface last week as part of his Halloween costume. Social media footage of the teacherâ€™s costume, and what appears to be an impromptu performance of him rapping about artificial intelligence and technology, has since gone viral and the teacher has reportedly been suspended. Ironically, he was dressed up as rapper Common Sense.
