        HI KITT, congratulations on Human – how does it feel to finally have it out there and generating such a positive reaction?
      
It's great, and at times a wee bit overwhelming. A lot of care and work and love went into the record, so the fact that people are taking the time to listen to it and respond to it at all – I'm definitely very appreciative of that, because we live in a very music saturated world.
I just really wanted the music to be out there because those tracks were all ready to be out there together on an album. It's like a sonic album of my own thoughts and observations over the last few years.

        What can you tell us about the album's title track, Human?
      
I suppose with everything that goes on in the world, positive and negative and inbetween, things can sometimes feel quite divisive.
We all live inside our own heads and we all have our own experiences, and that's all a very personal thing. But yet, us identifying as human beings is something that we all share. I just think that's really nice and it's good to reinforce that rather than everything that's different about us all or whatever.
