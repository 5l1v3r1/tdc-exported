        Agent 007 has had many faces over the 57-year cinematic history of Ian Fleming's jet-setting British spy. The first film, “Dr. No” was released in 1962, while the last, “Spectre”, hit movie screens around the world in 2015. In total, 26 films were shot, and the honour of playing the martini-drinking man of mystery has fallen to 7 actors.
      
Harry Styles, a 25-year-old singer formerly of the UK boy band One Direction recently disclosed that he'd love to replace Daniel Craig as the the next James Bond.
However, at the moment, he is focused on his music career; his new single Lights Up was among the UK's top 10 singles last week.
In any event, origins stories are popular these days and Harry Styles could be perfectly suited to play a young Agent 007. It may seem like a stretch, but Doctor Who is a woman now, so you never know.
