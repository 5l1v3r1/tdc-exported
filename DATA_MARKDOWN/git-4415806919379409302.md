The New York Giants surrendered a 12-3 second-quarter lead to crash to their fifth successive defeat as the Dallas Cowboys ran out 37-18 winners atÂ MetLife Stadium.
Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott was intercepted off his very first pass but recovered to throw for 257 yards and three touchdowns to leave the Cowboys 5-3 for the season and top of the NFC East.
New York, in contrast, have now fallen to 2-7 for the campaign following this latest loss.
