ISLAMABAD: Aqsa Kausar, an accomplished graduate of NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS), has beaten the odds by becoming the first female Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning from Pakistan. She is currently working as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) developer with a software organisation named Red Buffer.
‘Machine Learning’ is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.
Aqsa has done her Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from NUST. She has risen to acclaim at such a young age through her contributions to the field of Machine Learning.
