Is there anything better than a crush?
No.
Luckily, the past decade has been particularly ripe with crushes, keeping the flames of our hearts stoked as we made our way through the modern world. To celebrate them — and the act of crushing in general — we’ve compiled the 69 biggest crushes we’ve had over the past 10 years.
Whether you’re into sweet men trying to navigate the zombie apocalypse, or strong Greek assassins who are incredibly good at flirting, or space dads, our list (like your crushes!!!) has it all.
The return of Twin Peaks was, all told, one of the best things that ever happened to me, and the return of Dale Cooper specifically was a blessing. He is still absolutely beautiful, if now even more of a tragic hero. —Karen Han
Sick dragon back tat? Check. K-pop star voiced by the fabulous Soyeon of (G)i-dle? Check. Will annihilate me in lane and walk away like it’s nothing? Check, check, check. —Julia Lee
