A woman in her 60s has died after a tree is believed to have fallen on her car in Dorset.
The driver, who has not been named but is known to be a local, was pronounced dead at the scene following the incident in Verwood Road, Wimborne, shortly after 8.40am on Saturday.
It came as high winds buffeted the area, with gusts of more than 80mph in parts of the South West.
Police said it is understood a tree had fallen on the grey Ford B-Max, and officers appealed for anyone who saw what happened to get in touch.
Sergeant Lee Savage said: “To assist with my investigation I am appealing to anyone who was travelling in the area at the relevant time, and either witnessed the collision or captured any of the incident on dash-cam, to please contact Dorset Police.”
