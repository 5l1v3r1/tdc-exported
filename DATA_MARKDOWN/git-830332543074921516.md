MADISON, Wis. - The city of Madison is holding a public input meeting tonight at 6:30 p.m. at the Madison Municipal Building to see how Madison residents think the hairball intersection can be improved. 
The streets being considered for construction include John Nolen and South Blair Street. 
City of Madison Engineering Division spokesperson Hannah Mohelnitzky said some ideas that are being considered are putting more turn lanes in, installing pedestrian lighting and improving road surfacing. She added that the state of Wisconsin will fund the major roads, while other improvements to local streets will be funded by the city.
