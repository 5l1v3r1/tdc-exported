Plymouth Argyle head of operations Jon Back has said there was no other option but to postpone the League Two game against Grimsby Town at Home Park this afternoon.
The decision was taken on safety grounds after a section of roof at the Barn Park End became loose following severe winds overnight.
The game was called off at around 12.30pm so many Grimsby supporters had either completed their trips to Plymouth or were well on the way to doing so.
Many members of the Green Army had also arrived at Home Park for the fixture.
So there was disappointment all round about the postponement but, as Back explained in an interview with Plymouth Live, it was an unavoidable decision.
Unfortunately, the stadium has been subject to some structural damage overnight. A roof section on the Barn Park End – so on the horseshoe side of the stadium – has come loose.
We have been assessing with urgency this morning. We have brought in structural engineers from Plymouth City Council.
They have looked at it and the assessment is that it’s unsafe.
There is a likelihood that it will come off at some stage and, of course, given the blustery winds we can’t be certain of what direction that will go.
