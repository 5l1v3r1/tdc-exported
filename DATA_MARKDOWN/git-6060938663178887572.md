Slaying the hearts of her millions of followers, Sunny Leone has never failed to amaze us with her sensual dance moves. The actress has carved a niche for herself in Bollywood with her brilliant performances. It's been quite a while since we saw the stunner on the big screens, but Sunny has always made our jaws drop with her sizzling pictures and videos on her social media handles.
Just a while ago, Sunny took to her Instagram handle to share a video of her rehearsing her famous song 'Laila Main Laila' from Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Raees.' The actress is seen rehearsing the sensual dance moves along with her team. Donning a white crop top and black pants, Sunny looks beautiful as she makes a sweet gesture of salutation at the end of the video.
After making into the hearts of millions with her roles on-screen, the actress has now moved down the southern film industry to set her foot there. The actress will also be making a debut in a Tamil film with a period drama, 'Veeramadevi'. Meanwhile, Sunny will be next seen in a horror comedy film titled, 'Coca Cola'.
