Boris Johnson has urged voters to back him in order to get parliament working “for you”.
Speaking outside Number 10 after an audience with the Queen to officially dissolve parliament, Johnson said the choice was to “come with us – a government that believes in a dynamic economy – or vote for Labour, “the only alternative”.
The PM went onto attack Labour for its position on Brexit, which would take up the bulk of next year with another referendum, causing more “dither and delay”.
