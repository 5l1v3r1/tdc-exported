The head of migrant research at the Federal Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Herbert Brücker, speaking to the German newspaper Die Welt said: “Currently, about a quarter of the people in Germany have a migrant background. In 20 years, it will be at least 35 per cent, but could also be more than 40 per cent.”
Brücker expects that the percentage will probably be much higher in German cities, saying in comments reported by DW: “What we see in the big cities today will be normal for the country as a whole in the future.”
“In a city like Frankfurt, we’ll have between 65 per cent to 70 per cent,” he added.
In 2017, Frankfurt became the first German city to have a higher percentage of people with a migration background than native Germans.
