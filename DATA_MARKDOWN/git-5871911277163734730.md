NWA Powerrr has received praise from all corners of the professional wrestling world. The one hour program, which streams live every Tuesday at 6:05pm EST on the companyâ€™s YouTube channel, has been the talk of fans from the moment it debuted back on October 8.
Now WWE Hall of Famer Edge has joined the chorus of NWA supporters, who believe that Powerrr has indeed been a hit and has benefitted the company as a result.
