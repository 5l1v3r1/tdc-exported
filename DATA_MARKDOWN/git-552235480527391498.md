Sir Andy Murray will open up about his two-year injury hell in an emotional new documentary.
Andy Murray: Resurfacing, which launches on Amazon Prime Video on November 29, follows the tennis legend as he battled to save his career after suffering a debilitating hip injury.
 
It includes footage from the operating theatre, his rehab and of dad-of-three Andy at home with his family.
The two-time Wimbledon champion, 32, said: “At times it felt like I was letting people down by not being able to perform on court, and I wanted to give them an insight into what I was going through.
“The film will take you on a journey through what were some of the lowest, most difficult periods of my life both physically and mentally, and will hopefully show and inspire viewers that, with the right mindset and work ethic, anything is possible.”
 
Andy, who had hip surgery in January 2018 and January this year, won the European Open last month to claim his first singles title since his return to tennis.
