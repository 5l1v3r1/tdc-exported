Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang pushed for ranked-choice voting in a tweet on Tuesday, as New York City voters consider a potential change to the city's constitution that would incorporate such ballots into primary and special elections.
Yang, an unorthodox candidate who's portrayed himself as an "Asian man who likes math," has made ranked-choice voting an issue in his candidacy.
New York's system would allow voters to rank their five favorite candidates in order. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the last -place candidate would be eliminated and the voters who chose him or her would then have their second-choice votes applied. The process would repeat until one candidate received a majority of votes. Yang's campaign website advocates for a system that allows voters to choose three candidates instead of five, but would essentially function the same way.
"Just voted here in New York - Ranked Choice Voting is on the ballot!" Yang tweeted. "Ranked choice voting would let us express our true preferences and make our politics more dynamic and responsive. We should make it the norm throughout the country."
