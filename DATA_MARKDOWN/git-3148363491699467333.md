Documentary maker Nick Bullen told Fox News the former Suits star, who has retained her U.S. citizenship, is “rewriting” what it means to be a member British Royalty and she’s determined to make a difference. He added:
Bullen has been making programs about the British Royal family for nearly 20 years, and has worked with Harry’s father, Prince Charles, for eight.
He recently released a new documentary titled Meghan for President? which explores the former American actress’ viewes on gender and race, as well as her commitment to philanthropic causes.
Bullen says the world shouldn’t be surprised if Markle would consider taking on a humanitarian ambassador’s role in the states or even setting her eyes further on politics. Based on rare footage of Markle’s upbringing, along with statements from those who knew her, he says Markle has always yearned to make a change long before she became a familiar face on television.
