HONG KONG:Â Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon Saturday as thousands of protesters defied authorities in another unsanctioned march after Beijing vowed to tighten control over the restless city.
Commercial districts on the main island turned into a battleground as crowds of black-clad protesters, many wearing face masks despite a recent ban, clashed for hours with riot police.
Hardcore protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs and vandalised multiple subway stations and businesses perceived to be pro-China - including the office of China's state-run Xinhua news agency, which had its windows smashed.
