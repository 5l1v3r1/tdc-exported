“Westworld” actor Jeffrey Wright compared President Donald Trump to infamous cult leader Charles Manson on Thursday.
The first tweet Wright sent was a video of Rep. Devin Nunes speaking on the House floor, defending Trump against his opponents' ongoing push for impeachment. Nunes compares Democrats and the media to cult followers.

“But they have no evidence and no argument to support impeachment. All they have is the unconditional cooperation of the media to advance their preposterous narrative,” he says. “If they had a real case, they wouldn’t be wasting time spoon-feeding ridiculous attacks that include defamation and slander on both current and former staff on the intelligence committee.”
