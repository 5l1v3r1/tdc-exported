Tickets for Alanis Morissette‘s one-night-only acoustic performance of Jagged Little Pill at The Apollo go on presale today (11/7) at 10 AM. If you signed up for Alanis’ mailing list, you should have gotten a presale code sent to you, or you can use the Live Nation presale password: RHYTHM.
If you miss out on the presale, you can try again for tickets when the public on-sale starts Friday (11/8) at 10 AM. A few days after this show, the Broadway adaptation of the Jagged Little Pill show opens.
