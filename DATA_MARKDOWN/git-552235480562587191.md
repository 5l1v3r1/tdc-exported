Ryan Kent has warned Rangers ’ rivals there’s still more to come from him.
The 22-year-old winger looked back to his best in Sunday’s 3-0 Betfred Cup semi-final win over Hearts and set up one of the goals.
But £7million Kent, fit again after a hamstring injury picked up against Livingston in September, said: “ I would probably say I am around 85 per cent at the moment.
“I am still struggling to do two games in one week on top of training sessions as well.”
Kent, who was replaced by Joe Aribo in the 66th minute to huge applause from the Gers supporters at Hampden, added: “Me and the physios will be managing myself correctly so I can make an impact on the games I do play.
“I think my fitness levels are high, as long as I can manage my training time and my minutes like Sunday. That gives me the best chance possible of helping the team.
“Once I get a run of games under my belt and get into the swing again, I will probably be seeing better performances.
“But right now my focus is just on maintaining fitness. I can’t really afford to have another injury like the last one.”
