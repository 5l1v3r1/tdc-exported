A 21-year-old man has been charged after a teen allegedly died having 'rough sex in a car’ following a Halloween party.
Michael T. Gaffney is accused of reckless manslaughter following the death of Francis Victoria Garcia, from Bloomingdale, New Jersey.
The 19-year-old was found unconscious in the back seat of a car on Friday night and taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead.
Earlier in the evening she had attended a Halloween party in a block of flats before leaving with a man, claims the Daily Voice.
Police are investigating whether a drug overdose or "rough sex" was the possible cause of her death, according to reports.
Gaffney, from Maywood, allegedly told police that he and Francis had taken prescription medication and were having sex when she lost consciousness, a law enforcement source said.
It is alleged she had bruises on her neck.
It is not clear whether Francis and Gaffney knew each other previously or if they had just met at the party.
Bergen County Prosecutor Mark Musella told local media the sudden death was considered "suspicious" and a post-mortem was taking place to determine the cause.
The car was later towed from the scene as police conducted a forensic investigation.
