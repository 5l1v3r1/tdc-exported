REUTERS: Indonesian rider Afridza Munandar died after a crash in the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup (IATC) race at the Sepang International Circuit on Saturday.
The incident occurred when Munandar went down at turn 10 on the first lap, before the race was stopped immediately with a red flag and then cancelled.
After receiving medical attention by the side of the track, the 20-year-old was transferred to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.
"The FIM (International Motorcycling Federation), FIM Asia, Dorna Sports, and all those in the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup pass on our deepest condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Munandar," the race organisers said in a statement.
Munandar was one of the championship contenders heading into this weekend's finale of the 2019 IATC, having recorded two wins and four podium finishes this season.
