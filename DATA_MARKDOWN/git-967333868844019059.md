        Earlier, Facebook imposed a ban on certain emojis with double meanings, such as the "eggplant" and "peach", that are popularly exchanged to symbolise male genitalia and buttocks in a bid to curb "sexual solicitation" on social media platforms.
      
Amongst the growing number of emoji options there is one that users are getting extremely excited over.
The new emoji is a cartoonised version of “a person kneeling on both knees”, according to Emojipedia.
