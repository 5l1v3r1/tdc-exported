The trial of a man accused of murdering British backpacker in New Zealand is expected to begin in Auckland on Wednesday.
Grace Millane, from Wickford in Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she arrived in New Zealand last November.
The body of the 22-year-old was found in a forested area near Auckland a week after she was last seen at a hotel in the city centre on December 2.
The 27-year-old man alleged to have killed her pleaded not guilty to the crime in January.
He re-entered that plea yesterday when the trial began with the selection of seven women and five men to form a jury.
His name cannot be published due to a suppression order.
The trial in Auckland High Court before Justice Simon Moore is expected to last for up to five weeks.
