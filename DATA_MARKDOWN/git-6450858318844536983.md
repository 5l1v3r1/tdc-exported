Though the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are now the previous generation of Google phones, they're still a solid option if you're looking for a smartphone with a great camera. If you want to get your hands on a contract or SIM-free bargain, then this is the article for you. We’re always scouring the web to find the cheapest prices for both these models. 
The Pixel 3 and 3 XL have new designs with higher screen to body ratios, improved cameras, wireless charging and more. They're available in three colours: Just Black, Clearly White and Not Pink. You can read our review of the Pixel 3 here and of the Pixel 3 XL here.
If you want to spend a little less, there's also the mid-range Pixel 3a and 3a XL phones – you can see those deals here. Or if you want the latest Google flagship phones, then take a look at the best deals for the Pixel 4 range. 
The Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL arrived in November 2018 and start at £739/US$799. In May 2019, the firm added the mid-range Pixel 3a and 3a XL to the range.
Below, we've listed the latest retailers and networks that stock Pixel phones. Unfortunately, ahead of the launch of the Pixel 4, the 3 and 3 XL are now out of stock in most retailers, so they can be tricky to get hold of. We've marked the retailers below that still have stock of at least one model at the time of writing, but it might be worth checking the others too just in case the situation changes.
We've got price comparison tools available below for each Pixel 3 (click here if you can't see it to go to a version of this page optimised for your device). You can use the sliders and drop down menus to tailor the contracts to your needs.
Here are some of the top deals across all the networks for the Pixel 3.
