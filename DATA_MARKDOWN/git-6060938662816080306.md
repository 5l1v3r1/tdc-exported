RAJKOT: Stand-in India skipper Rohit Sharma achieved a rare feat on Thursday when he took the field in the second T20I of the three-match series against Bangladesh at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot. Rohit became the first Indian men player and second globally in men's cricket to feature in 100 T20I games.
Pakistan's Shoaib Malik (111 T20Is) is the only player to have played more than 100 games in the shortest format of the game at the international level.
Speaking on achieving the milestone, Rohit said: "Firstly, I never thought I would play so many games. I am grateful for the opportunity I got in the past and till date as well. It has been a long journey since I made my debut as there had been many ups and downs. I have now understood my game. Yes, I am very happy where I stand right now."
