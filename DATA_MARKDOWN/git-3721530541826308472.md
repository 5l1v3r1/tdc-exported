Gris is a moving game about working through trauma. The debut effort from Nomada Studio, a small team in Barcelona, Spain, it ranks among our top 50 games of 2018. One of the things that pushed it to the fore was its remarkable art style and unique animations. Now, publisher Devolver Digital says, those features have been plagiarized by the makers of a health and fitness app.
“The Fabulous app (@GetTheFabulous) ripped off GRIS,” Devolver tweeted this morning, “and is a reminder to all devs to be mindful of big companies and brands stealing creative work from smaller studios.”
