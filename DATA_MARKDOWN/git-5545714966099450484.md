You guessed it, Sega has released another theme song for one of the female cast members of upcoming RPG Project Sakura Wars. It seems pretty obvious that they're going to have more than enough to fill an album when all is said and done.This latest track, Niji no Kanata, features the bright talents of Shanghai Revue associate Huang Yui. The spirited ditty is sung by Huang's voice actor, Sumire Uesaka, and is a little more hopeful and wistful than some of the other numbers released so far. What Huang's role will be in the theatre of war remains to be seen, although we do get to see her piloting a cute-looking mech in the video.Project Sakura Wars launches on PS4 in Japan December 12, before heading west in 2020. A demo is coming to Japanese PSN on November 21.
