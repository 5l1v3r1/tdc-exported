REUTERS: La Liga side Celta Vigo have sacked coach Fran Escriba hours after his side were beaten 1-0 at home to Getafe on Sunday.
"Fran Escriba will not continue in charge of Celta. The club would like to thank him and his coaching staff for their efforts and commitment and wish them success in the future," the Galician club said in a statement.
Sunday's defeat to Getafe was Celta's fourth defeat in a row and left them 18th in the standings on nine points after 12 games, two behind Real Mallorca who occupy the last berth outside the drop zone.
A former coach of Villareal, Getafe and Elche, Escriba took charge of Celta in March and helped them avoid relegation but his side have only managed to win two games this season, drawing three and losing seven.
