BWG Foods Wholesale and Value Centre Castlebar is aiming to plug a gap in the market with the introduction of its dedicated alcohol free section, coined the “Zero Bar”. with alcohol free options across wine, prosecco, beer, cider and gin.
Alcohol free range sales have increased 224% since last year, driven by the health and wellness trend, with the worldwide market for non-alcoholic beer projected to double to about more than €20 billion by 2024, according to market research firm Global Market Insights.
This statistic infers the need and demand for alcohol-free options that still remind consumers of alcohol.
In response to this Global trend, Value Centre Castlebar has moved quickly to adapt and ensure the tastes of our customers are catered for, especially with the Christmas period approaching.
Corporate Gifting remains a very strong component of the festive season for businesses in Ireland and Value Centre Castlebar, recognising a gap in the market for innovative gifting ideas, has shifted gears this year and expanded their offering to include healthy and alcohol free hamper options.
