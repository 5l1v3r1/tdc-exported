In my imagination, Deep Down was an incredible dungeon-crawling RPG from Capcom.
It came out on PlayStation 4 as originally intended, we all played it, we all loved it, the public discourse shifted a few months later to suddenly deem it "overrated," and now we're dying for a sequel.
In reality, Deep Down is little more than a pipe dream at this point.
