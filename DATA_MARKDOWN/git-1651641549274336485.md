Microsoft’s Your Phone app has been popular among mobile users and recently the app even topped the free app category on the Google Play Store. The app, however, was missing one key feature which has now been added.
In a recent update, Microsoft has added the preview feature to the app. This will now allow users to preview pictures within the Your Phone app. Earlier, you will have to either download or open the picture in the Photos app to check it out.
The feature seems to have been added recently and it looks to be a phased rollout. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to try it out on our Windows 10 devices so it might be a while before everyone gets the new update.

        Thanks, Adam for the tip!
