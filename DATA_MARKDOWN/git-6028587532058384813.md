Topline: Meetup is laying off up to 25% of its workforce, TechCrunch reported Monday, as its owner, the embattled real estate startup WeWork, looks to cut costs after a highly-publicized failed IPO attempt and a major decrease in its valuation.
Key background: The Meetup restructuring comes as its owner WeWork is looking to cut costs after a disastrous IPO attempt, the ouster of the company’s founder and CEO Adam Neumann, and the public unraveling over the last few months of the startup once valued at $47 billion. WeWork last month accepted a $9.5 billion bailout offer from its largest shareholder, Softbank, and may also be laying off 4,000 people, or 30% of its workforce.
Tangent: Meetup last month announced it was testing a $2 event fee, leading to a revolt among Meetup event organizers, who blamed the pricing test on WeWork’s financial troubles.
