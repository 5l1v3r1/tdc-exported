        Daniel Ricciardo has said that Renault needs to accept the fact the McLaren are in front of them now. McLaren holds 38 point advantage going into the final three races and it's highly unlikely that Renault will be able to overtake the fourth-placed teams in the final races.
      
The McLaren duo qualified in P7 and P8 for the United States Grand Prix whilst Ricciardo and Nico Hulkenberg reached ninth and 11th respectively.
“Obviously they’ve been a target for us this year but now that we’re at the end of the year, pretty much, I think we have to accept that they’ve been better than us this year and more times than not now they’re going to be faster than us,” Ricciardo told RaceFans.net.
“It’s just how it is. “To be disappointed they’re in front now doesn’t really make sense any more because I think that we have to accept that at the moment they are in front. So being behind them, I think was the best I could do.
“I’m obviously not saying we’re going to give up for the next few races. But looking ahead to next year, hopefully, we can bring them back towards us."
Toro Rosso are just nine points adrift of Renault in sixth, which makes for an interesting finish to the season.
