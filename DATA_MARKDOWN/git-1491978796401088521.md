Donald Trump’s rough welcome at the hands of Washington Nationals fans at last month’s World Series gained widespread attention, but the players themselves – or the ones in attendance, at least – were rather more friendly during a visit to the White House on Monday.
During Trump’s visit to Nationals Park for Game 5 of the series, he was greeted with jeers and chants of “lock him up” by the home crowd. The Nationals went on to beat the Houston Astros in Game 7 last week to claim their first-ever World Series title, and received the customary invitation from the White House to celebrate.
One player, relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, said last week he would not attend due to the president’s “divisive rhetoric”. Ten of his teammates were absent on Monday, although they did not specify reasons for their absence.
One player who seemed to be happy to meet Trump on Monday was catcher Kurt Suzuki. When Trump invited him to speak, he donned a Make America Great Again cap.
“I didn’t know that was gonna happen,” Trump said.
