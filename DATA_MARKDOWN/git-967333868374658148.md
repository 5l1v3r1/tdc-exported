        New Delhi (Sputnik): India’s decision to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has been widely welcomed by political parties, farmers’ groups and social activists. New Delhi decided not to sign the agreement, as its concerns were not addressed by the grouping.
      
India’s largest milk cooperative and food products marketing entity Amul went the extra mile, with its iconic topical advertisements, to hail Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not signing the RCEP.
According to the coop, junking the treaty has “safe-guarded” the interest of the farm, small industry and dairy sectors.
