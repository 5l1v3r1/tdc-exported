The NES and SNES Classic Editions have done incredible business for Nintendo, and have triggered a wave of similar consoles from the likes of Sega, Capcom, Konami and SNK.
Given the success of these two micro-consoles, many expected Nintendo to follow up with another project – perhaps based on the N64 or Game Boy – but it would seem that the company is focusing its hardware efforts elsewhere right now.
Speaking to The Verge, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said:
Looks like we'll just have to make do with the upcoming Analogue Pocket, right? In the meantime, let us know if you were hoping to see a Game Boy or N64 Classic Edition sooner rather than later.
