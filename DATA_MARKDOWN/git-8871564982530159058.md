In a bizarre roadside scene, people were shoveling thousands of squirming live catfish from the side of a road in the Thai south.
A slippery road in Krabi province’s Khlong Thom district sent a truck onto its side Sunday to spill 2 metric tons of catfish onto the road, where multiple people – including a tween boy – got to work helping the owner return them to the truck.
