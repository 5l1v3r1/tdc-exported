Yung Lean has shared a hazy new track today. You can listen to ‘Blue Plastic’ below.
Produced by Sad Boys member Gud, the slow, hazy, low-fi track deals with themes of isolation and loneliness and is described in a press release as “firmly like a de-accelerated ignition, its subdued melodic composition detonating and shimmering all over the shambling beat like fireworks in slow-motion.”
Lyrics include: “Everyone’s got ideas, but they’re all wrong/Nobody wants to get it, but they’re all foretold…I exposed myself, I’m done, I’m down/I’m done, I’m down.”
