Vast quantities of foam in Salford’s River Irwell baffled members of the public on Tuesday morning.
The phenomenon was described on social media as “bizarre” and “weird” by those in the area, while another added “looks like loads of soap suds”.
An Environment Agency spokesman confirmed that the organisation was aware of “foam pollution” in the Irwell as well as the River Roch, but a spokesman told the PA news agency that it was unaware of the source.
