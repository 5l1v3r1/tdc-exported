Robin McBryde believes the future is bright for Welsh rugby as a new era dawns.
Wales ended their World Cup campaign in Japan with a 40-17 defeat in the bronze medal match against New Zealand.
It was the final game of a 12-year reign for head coach Warren Gatland, defence specialist Shaun Edwards and forwards coach McBryde.
Wales won four Six Nations titles, three Grand Slams, reached two World Cup semi-finals and were briefly world-ranked number one during that time.
Gatlandâ€™s fellow New Zealander Wayne Pivac, assisted by the likes of Stephen Jones and Jonathan Humphreys, now takes over and will lead Wales against a Gatland-coached Barbarians team in Cardiff on November 30.
And a new generation of Welsh talent has been highlighted by wing Josh Adams and flanker Aaron Wainwright, who excelled on the world stage.
