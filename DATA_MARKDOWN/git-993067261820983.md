Green Party Northern Ireland leader Clare Bailey has confirmed she will not run in South Belfast, and instead urged her supporters to vote for the SDLP's Claire Hanna.
The constituency is expected to see a close race between Ms Hanna and the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly.
Ms Bailey said she made the decision based on her stance on Brexit, urging voters to return a pro-Remain MP in South Belfast.
"Almost 70 per centÂ of the people of South Belfast voted to remain in the EU and it is vital that a pro-Remain MP is returned," she said.
"This is a first-past-the-post election and Claire Hanna is best placed to take the South Belfast seat from the incumbent pro-Brexit MP, based on previous results."
Claire Hana said she was "genuinely thrilled to have the backing of the Green Party":
