        "Long before the release, we talked about sequels."
      
Joker star Joaquin Phoenix has revealed if he’d potentially star in a sequel to the acclaimed comic book melodrama.
The movie, which stars Phoenix as Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime, debuted to wide acclaim last month – including a five star review from NME.
It then went on to become the highest r-rated movie of all time, after securing over $700 million at the global box office.
But despite the success, Phoenix insists that he’d only take part in a sequel if he deemed it to be a worthy successor.
Speaking to The Envelope (via LA Times), Phoenix admitted: “I wouldn’t just do a sequel just because the first movie is successful, that’s ridiculous.”
However, he’s definitely discussed the prospect of a follow-up with director Todd Phillips.
