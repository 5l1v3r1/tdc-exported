How does one make a video review for Death Stranding, a game with like 900 trailers – many of which the game’s director, Hideo Kojima, edited himself? On November 8th, 2019, the meta-game of guessing what Death Stranding is will end and the meta-meta-game of playing Death Stranding will begin. Until then, while we still have four days left to enjoy the meta-game, please watch this bizarre, spoiler-free, one-hour video in which I review Death Stranding five times.
