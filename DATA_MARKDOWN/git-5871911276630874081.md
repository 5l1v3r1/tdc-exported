After the successful invasion of Friday Night SmackDown by the NXT talent, reports have been making their way to social media that the same thing could be happening on the November 4 edition of Monday Night Raw.
PWInsider first broke the news, reporting that NXT Champion Adam Cole, NXT North American Champion Roderick Strong, Matt Riddle, and Damian Priest have all been spotted in New York City, the host of Raw on November 4.

It is also noted that officials have given the go-ahead for a full-blown NXT invasion after garnering a positive reaction after the November 1 Friday Night SmackDown.
Since NXT has been announced as taking part of this year’s Survivor Series, murmurs of a possible invasion were just that until Friday.  Whether the brand will follow through with its onslaught of the main roster is highly speculated, but if reports are correct, then fans are certainly in store for a “Takeover” on the flagship show.
