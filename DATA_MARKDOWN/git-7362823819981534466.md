Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love conducted a spooky postgame interview Wednesday after the team’s victory over the Chicago Bulls.
Love came into the Quicken Loans Arena dressed as Jason from the Halloween horror movie “Friday The 13th.” He scored 17 points and grabbed 20 rebounds in 31 minutes in the win and decided to stay in the Halloween spirit when talking to reporters after the game.
