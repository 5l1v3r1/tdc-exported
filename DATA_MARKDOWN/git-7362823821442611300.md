"Black Panther" star Letitia Wright throws shade at journalists and the media for ignoring her Christian faith.
The British actress, who was the biggest box office star in 2018 for her role as Shuri in Marvel's "Black Panther" and "Avengers: Infinity War," tweeted Monday -- two days before Harper's Bazaar named her as one of their "Women of the Year," but did not mention her faith.

"It's super cute when journalists/interviewers for magazines leave out the massive part where I give God the glory for the success/ achievements in my life," Wright wrote.
