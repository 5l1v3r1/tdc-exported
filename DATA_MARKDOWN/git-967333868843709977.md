        Explosives appear to have become a staple in the arsenal of Swedish gangs. The south of the country alone now experiences one to two explosive attacks each week, making the Scandinavian country an international outlier among developed nations.
      
The number of bomb attacks in southern Sweden has doubled in less than a year, national broadcaster SVT reported.
Between January and October 2018, there were 34 explosions. In the same period year, there have been 71 blasts. According to National Bomb Protection analyst Ylva Ehrlin, the Swedish figures stand out internationally.
The number of blasts in southern Sweden alone is equivalent to one or two every week. For instance, this week, two heavy bombings occurred in Helsingborg, Sk√•ne County, severely damaging one house.
