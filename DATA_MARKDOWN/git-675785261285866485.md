Bayern Munich have reportedly rejected the chance to appoint former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as their next boss.
The 70-year-old called Bayern chief Karl-Heinz Rumenigge to declare his interest in the vacancy, according to German publication Bild.
But Rumenigge decided against appointing Wenger to replace Niko Kovac who was axed after Bayern's 5-1 humbling by Eintracht Frankfurt.
Wenger has been out of the dugout since leaving Arsenal at the end of the 2017-18 season after 22 years in north London.
He is keen to get back into management at the top level but has rejected several offers since walking out of the Emirates.

Hansi Flick is currently in caretaker charge of the Bavarians and led them to a 2-0 win over Olympiacos in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.
But bigger challenges lie ahead, starting this Saturday as Bayern host Dortmund in Der Klassiker at the Allianz Arena.
Bayern chiefs could now look towards Thomas Tuchel at PSG or Ajax's Erik ten Hag as a replacement for Kovac.
Max Allegri and Jose Mourinho have also been linked with the vacancy and Bayern will want to act quick having already fallen four points off the Bundesliga title place.
