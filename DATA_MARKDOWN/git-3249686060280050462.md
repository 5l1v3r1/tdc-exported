MONSTA X fans are continuing their hashtag campaign to support the group in the midst of some heavy drama that led to the departure of former member Wonho. 
Fans are using the hashtag #몬베베는_무너지지_않아 (MonbebesWontGiveUp) along with many others as they voice their support for the group. Fans have been starting petitions, voicing their opposition to Wonho's departure, and using social media as a tool to voice their opinions.
