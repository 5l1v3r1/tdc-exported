Police are struggling to contain thousands of Algerian demonstrators surging through the streets of the capital, Algiers, to protest against plans for next month's presidential election and celebrate the 65th anniversary of the start of the country's war for independence from France.
Waving Algerian and banned Berber flags during Friday's rally, demonstrators urged each other to remain peaceful as police tried to push them off sidewalks or clear them out of a central square.
It was the 37th such gathering since their pro-democracy movement began in February, and coincided with the anniversary of Algeria's war for liberation from French rule, which began on November 1, 1954.
Thousands of people came from other towns to join the protest in Algiers, some demonstrating peacefully in the streets overnight. In their homes, many residents banged on pots and pans to show support.
