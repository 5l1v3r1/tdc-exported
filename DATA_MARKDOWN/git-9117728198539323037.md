        Daniil Kvyat finished the race 10th on track but was given a penalty and dropped down to 12th after it was deemed he made an aggressive move on Sergio Perez. Toro Rosso had a poor weekend as they failed to score any points. 
      
“It was a tricky race, we were a little bit off the pace today compared to our direct competitors," Kvyat said after the race. "We used the tyres a bit more than we usually do, so we need to analyze that.

        "Even with those issues, I managed to finish P10 on track on the last lap. I think was a harsh but fair move, it was great racing like we want to see and what we have seen this season without other drivers being our sport needs.”
      
Toro Rosso dropped down a place in the constructor's championship and will hope that they can get back ahead of Racing Point in the next two races.
