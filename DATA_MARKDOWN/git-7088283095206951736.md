        The French government has urged business leaders and investors at a key summit last week to be bold about investing in Africa. Paris is banking on the potential of small to medium enterprises (SME) to catch up in the race with China. But investors are reluctant to follow suit.
      
When France launched its flagship Ambiton Africa business event last year celebrating opportunities on the African continent, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was absent. This year, Le Maire lost no time in attending the 2019 edition of the forum, which wrapped up last week, to hammer home an urgent message.
“We need to raise private sector capital, because the public sector alone cannot deliver Africa’s transformation,” he told business leaders and investors gathered at the French finance ministry.
