ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry has on Wednesday warned that Indus Water Treaty will be Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s next target, Dunya News reported.
The federal minister took to Twitter and cautioned to get prepared for a big loss as internal political conspiracies have diverted our attention from the plight of Kashmiris.
Don’t know how India is giving Pakistan the share of its water, Fawad Chaudhry said while adding that Pakistan does not even have time to blink.
