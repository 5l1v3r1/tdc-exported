John Malkovich declares himself to be “irresponsible, indolent, pompous and conceited” as the pontiff in the teaser trailer for The New Pope.
The Sky Atlantic series picks up where The Young Pope left off, with Pius XIII, played by Jude Law, in a coma.
Malkovich’s Sir John Brannox is chosen as his replacement and in the new footage from the show, he can be heard saying: “Everyone in the world should know who the Pope is. It’s not vanity, it’s necessity.”
