Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that billionaires are looking for a “safe space” from criticism after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rhetoric “vilifies successful people.”
“Y’all, the billionaires are asking for a safe space - you know, in addition to the entire US economy and political lobbying industry,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in reaction to Dimon saying that Warren used “pretty harsh words” against him and other billionaires.
