Rangers will travel to Dubai as the club revealed their plans for the winter break.
Steven Gerrard will try to prepare his side for what will be a crucial second half of the season.
And he hopes a trip to the UAE for a warm-weather training camp will stand them in good stead.
The first team will travel to Nad al Sheba Sports Complex from January 6 to 12, a place where the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, AC Milan and Juventus have trained.
Rangers will conclude their time abroad with a friendly, but the club have yet to confirm who they will face.
The Ibrox side will join Celtic as Neil Lennon's squad will also jet out to Dubai with their time off in the New Year.
Last season Gerrard's men were top of the Premiership table on goal difference going into the winter break, after a win over their rivals, but surrendered that marginal lead in their first game after the restart.
Kilmarnock came from behind to win 2-1 at Rugby Park as Celtic came flying out the blocks to regain control at the top thanks to an eight-game winning streak.
