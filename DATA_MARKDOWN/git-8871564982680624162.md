Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed a “high degree of trust” in Hong Kong’s deeply unpopular leader Carrie Lam as the two met after months of increasingly violent protests in the city.
Xi’s show of support follows speculation that Beijing was preparing to remove Lam as city authorities struggle to contain pro-democracy demonstrations that have rocked Hong Kong.
Their meeting on the sidelines of an international trade fair Monday followed another weekend of violence in Hong Kong that was marked by a knife attack and the vandalizing of an office of China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.
Xi said Lam has “done a lot of hard work” and strived to stabilize the situation in Hong Kong, according to a Xinhua readout of their meeting.
“Xi voiced the central government’s high degree of trust in Lam and full acknowledgement of the work of her and her governance team,” the state news agency said.
