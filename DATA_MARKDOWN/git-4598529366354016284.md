Several key witnesses in the House’s impeachment inquiry will be the fist to appear in public hearings next week.
The move toward public hearings, rather than the behind-closed-doors testimonies that have so far taken place in sealed rooms, marks a new phase in the impeachment inquiry.
The current acting ambassador to Ukraine, the former ambassador, and the deputy assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs will testify.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who’s largely led the inquiry’s closed-door depositions, announced the news on Twitter Wednesday.
“More to come,” he said.
