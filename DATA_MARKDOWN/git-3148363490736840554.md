The teenager, who has left school to travel the world preaching her message of climate salvation,  said she scared “a bunch of angry climate crisis deniers” without having to dress up.
Posing in a black-and-white photo with her trademark “school strike for climate” placard, she said she did not celebrate Halloween in Sweden but “thought I might give it a try'” if it meant she could affront her critics.
