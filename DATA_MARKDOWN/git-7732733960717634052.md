Adobe at its annual Adobe Max conference this week previewed a new app that brings the best of Photoshop directly to your smartphone camera.
Dubbed Photoshop Camera, the app primarily targets those looking to create and share “imaginative, high-quality images on social media.” The app uses Adobe Sensei, the company’s AI platform and framework, to automatically enhance imagery. For example, it can instantly recognize the subject in your photo, supply recommendations and automatically apply “sophisticated, unique features” to help your image stand out from the crowd while maintaining its originality.
