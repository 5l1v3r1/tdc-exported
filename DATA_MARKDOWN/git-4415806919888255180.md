Ian McKellen has joked he will be “long dead” before the Brexit deal is finished and said politicians are “wretched players and don’t know a pawn from a queen”.
The Lord Of The Rings actor said the ordeal has been so arduous he has decided he will no longer have an opinion on the proceedings.
He told the PA news agency: “I did think the other day, as we battle through Brexit, I thought ‘Oh good God, when I’m long dead they still won’t have the Brexit deal complete, so I think I won’t take a view on it.
“I’ve withdrawn entirely, emotionally, from the race and am now watching it as a bit of chess and all I can say is they are wretched players and don’t know a pawn from a queen.”
The veteran star, 80, who will next be seen starring opposite Helen Mirren in The Good Liar, added that “younger people don’t know what it’s like being old”.
