Things got a little out of hand once upon a time in a sparring session involving MMA veteran Wanderlei Silva and Chute Boxe Muay Thai coach Michael Costa.
In a classic video shared by ‘MMA Eejit’ on Twitter, the Brazilian apparently lost his temper after by caught with an axe kick, making Silva act like he was in one of his vintage fights, going all out with looping strikes against his teammate, to the point of knocking him down and raining down shots on the ground, as well.
The video, which goes on for 31 seconds, does not show the end of the action, but Costa seems dazed, to say the least, when the footage stops. You can watch the full recording below.
