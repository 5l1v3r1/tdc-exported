Al Pacino and Jordan Peele are set to team up next year for a new Amazon series about Nazi hunters.
Titled Hunters, it arrives in 2020, and follows a pack of Nazi hunters from 1970s New York.
A synopsis for the new show reads: “Hunters follows a diverse band of Nazi hunters living in 1977 New York City. The Hunters, as they’re known, have discovered that hundreds of high-ranking Nazi officials are living among us and conspiring to create a Fourth Reich in the U.S.
“The eclectic team of Hunters will set out on a bloody quest to bring the Nazis to justice and thwart their new genocidal plans.”
The series is also set to feature Logan Lerman (The Perks of Being A Wallflower), Josh Radnor (How I Met Your Mother), Kate Mulvany (The Great Gatsby) and more.
