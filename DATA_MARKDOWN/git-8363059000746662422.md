Airbnb is cracking down on “party houses” after a Halloween shooting at a U.S. residence rented through the service left five people dead earlier this week.
CEO Brian Chesky outlined how the company plans “to combat unauthorised parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct” in a Twitter thread Saturday. First and foremost: he announced an immediate ban on party houses. Thursday’s incident in Orinda, California, was at a home purportedly being advertised as the scene of a “mansion party” on social media according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The host had apparently rented the property under the guise that she was holding a family reunion for 12 people.
