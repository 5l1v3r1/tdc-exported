This Black Friday, you can pick up a Skyroam WiFi smartspof for 30 per cent off.
The offer kicks in from November 26, with 30 per cent off the Skyroam Solis X Travel Bundle that includes a travel case, multi-connector cord, and a five day pass card for Â£179.90. The Solix X usually costs that on its own, so if you're a frequent traveller, you might want to give it a look when it goes live in a couple weeks. That price will hold through Cyber Monday, until December 3.
