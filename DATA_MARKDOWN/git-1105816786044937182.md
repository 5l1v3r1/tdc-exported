HYDERABAD: An accident between a coach and a rickshaw on the National Highway in Sindh’s Matiari district claimed at least nine lives and injured three others, according to police and the local volunteers.
A rickshaw transporting local labourers to their workplace was struck by a coach carrying passengers from Punjab’s Layyah to Karachi. Local police confirmed that all the deceased and injured were labourers.
The deceased and injured were shifted to Taluka Hospital Saeedabad. Two of the injured are reportedly in a critical condition and they were referred to Hyderabad while another injured individual was sent to Nawabshah.
Following the collision, police impounded the coach, which was transporting passengers to Karachi.
However, the incident’s FIR has not been lodged so far.
The accident again displays lax regulation by the National Highway and Motorway Police as a rickshaw overloaded with passengers was allowed to travel on the highway.
