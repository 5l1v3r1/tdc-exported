The Archbishop of Tuam has commented on the ongoing row over the housing of asylum seekers in Achill and said Christians are morally obliged to welcome the stranger.
Bishop Michael Neary said it was well known, nationally and internationally, that Achill people are a welcoming people.
In a statement tonight the Archbishop of Tuam says in the past, Achill has accepted people from communities from around the world.
Referring to protests over a reported plan to house asylum seekers at a hotel on Achill island, he says Ireland is now moving from an era of austerity and recession to a more prosperous period in our economic cycle.
He said as Christians we are morally obliged to welcome the stranger and, in the context of our improved circumstances, we have a responsibility to share with those who are less fortunate than ourselves.
He went on to say we should also be particularly alert to those who are experiencing serious upheaval and a crisis of hope in their lives.
