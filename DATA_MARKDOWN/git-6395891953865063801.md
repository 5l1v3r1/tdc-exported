A group of more than 100 black female activists is endorsing Elizabeth Warren for president, saying her stances on a range of issues speak directly to black voters.
In a letter released on Thursday, the group Black Womxn For says its endorsement is an extension of activism that has helped shape a progressive agenda in the 2020 Democratic primary. The group calls Warren a "leader" and "partner" with a proven track record and understanding of structural racism and inequality who is willing to be held accountable.
The group's director, Angela Peoples, says she hopes the letter will encourage other black women to support the Massachusetts senator publicly.
Warren is scheduled to visit the historically black college North Carolina A&T State University later Thursday.
