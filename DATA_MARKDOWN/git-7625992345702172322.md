LeBron James has pulled off yet another epic Halloween costume — this time taking it to another level as Edward Scissorhands. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar shared photos of his convincing disguise on social media Thursday.
James, who last year dressed up as a spooky version of the clown "It," stayed with the fiction theme and picked one of Johnny Depp's most recognizable characters. The 34-year-old "Space Jam 2" actor called himself, "LeDward Scissorhands."
"Happy Halloween beautiful people," he wrote in the photo caption. He also took more pictures with "Sedusa" — his wife Savanah, who wore a Medusa costume.
James wasn't the only star athlete going all-out for Halloween. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara dressed up as hip-hop royalty, posing as Jay Z and Beyoncé.
Green Bay Packers tight end Jimmy Graham and team assistant trainer Nate Weir recreated the height difference between New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and Houston Astros shortstop Jose Altuve. The results were compelling and hilarious.
