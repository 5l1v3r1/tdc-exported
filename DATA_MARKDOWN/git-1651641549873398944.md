Earlier this week, Apple announced the new AirPods Pro which came with a host of features like active noise cancellation and more. While AirPods have a bad reputation in terms of repairability, we expected Apple to improve upon their design but that wasnâ€™t the case.
As iFixit found out, Apple AirPods are just as unrepairable as their predecessors. They noted that the AirPods Pro are semi-modular but are glued in together making repairs really hard, if not impossible. All these issues resulted in AirPods Pro scoring a big fat 0 in terms of repairability. You can head below to read the highlights of the teardown and check out the official video posted by iFixit.
