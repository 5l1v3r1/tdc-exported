(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Monday it was planning to offer a high-interest online savings account early next year to users of its American Airlines co-branded credit card.
The savings account, Citi Miles Ahead savings account, will offer up to 50,000 miles as a sign-on bonus and a 25% boost on miles earned through the card, the bank said in a statement.
The digital service will only be available in areas where the bank does not have physical branches.
American Airlines did not immediately respond to Reutersâ€™ request for comment.
