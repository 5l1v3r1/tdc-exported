Nintendo's Switch Pro Controller has certainly made a name for itself. Apart from being a great way to enjoy games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, over on Valve's platform Steam, it's become one of the most popular and most-used controllers for PC gaming platform.
In somewhat related news, the controller is now officially compatible with Android 10 devices. While this gamepad could technically already connect with a smartphone or tablet device beforehand, this new update rolled out by Google correctly maps the buttons.
To pair your Pro Controller with Android 10, all you have to do is click the sync button on the back pf the controller (near the USB-C port) and then activate the Bluetooth function on your smart device. This will allow you to play games of all sorts, on your phone or tablet.
