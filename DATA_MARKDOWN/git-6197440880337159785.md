Despite missteps and issues, if you happen to have a Pixel 4 on Google Fi, you can now enable RCS messaging with DSDS support also added.
A tweet by Sanaz Ahari, the Senior Director of Product & Design at Google confirmed that DSDS support has been rolled out to the Pixel 4, Google Fi subscribers should now also have RCS messaging support included too (h/t Android Central).
While RCS support great news for those of you using the Pixel 4 with a Google Fi SIM, for anyone else, youâ€™ll have to rely on workarounds to enjoy the iMessage-like Rich Communication Services alongside your regular SMS messaging. RCS is available on supported networks but there are some issues with cross-network messaging if RCS is not fully supported by your carrier network-wide.
With Google Fi being an MVNO, the service relies heavily on the infrastructure of partner carriers. Sprint is one partner carrier that has pledged support for the RCS protocol, which explains why the support is now being made available.
