        It’s about moving on and not allowing anyone to get in the way of that
      
Dua Lipa has shared her new, disco-tinged single ‘Don’t Start Now’ together with a new video which you can watch below.
The ‘New Rules’ pop star signalled her “new era” at the beginning of the month by posting an image of herself sporting a new blonde look. “Thank you for your patience. See you soon,” she told fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the follow-up to her 2017 self-titled debut.
Lipa described the new song ‘Don’t Start Now’ as a “pure adrenalin fuelled, feel good dance floor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment.”
“I chose to put this song out first so I could close one chapter of my life and start another,” she said. “Into a new era with a new sound! It’s about moving on and not allowing anyone to get in the way of that. It also felt like a natural first song choice as I made it with the brilliant same crew I made ‘New Rules’ with.”
On the infectious single, Lipa sings, “Don’t show up/ Don’t come out/ Don’t start caring about me now/ Walk away/ You know how.”
