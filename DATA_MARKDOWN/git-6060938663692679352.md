BHUBANESWAR: Fifth minute - India 0 USA 1. Fourteenth minute - India 0 USA 2. Twentieth minute - India 0 USA 3. Twenty-eighth minute - India 0 USA 4. Aggregate scores level. India women were ahead by four goals after winning the first game on Friday 5-1. But the USA made it even-stevens inside the first half of the second here at the Kalinga Stadium 24 hours later. Minute No. 49. Rani Rampal lurks at top of the American circle, waving, crying for the ball. It comes. The skipper takes aim. GOAL! India now had the numbers to take them to the Olympics. And it happened. After 11 goal-less minutes that followed, the Indian girls jumped in controlled joy, as they had lost. But the bigger result -- they are going to Tokyo, the third Olympic appearance for India's women hockey.
USA won 4-1, but India won the two-match tie 6-5 on aggregate.
