The UK-based game developer Rockstar North hasn't paid corporation tax in a decade despite scoring billions in revenue.
The fact that they've claimed public funds while (legally) avoiding taxation really drives the point home.
A model version of this wheeze:
Company A is in Nation X. Company B is in Nation Y. Company B agrees to pay Company A $10m for the rights to Company A's intellectual property. Company B makes $5m on the resulting product. Company B owes $10m, so it reports a loss to Nation Y's taxman. Company A never gets the $10m it's owed, so reports a loss to Nation X's taxman.
The twist: Company B is owned by Company A, and may even trade under the same damn name.
The question: Where is the $5m revenue?
The answer used to be "an Irish bank," but times change.
