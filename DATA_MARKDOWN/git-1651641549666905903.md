Samsung is rumoured to launch the Galaxy S11 in Q1 of 2020. The device will be the successor to the existing S10 and preliminary leaks surrounding the device have been promising. The recent Galaxy flagships have seen an overhaul in the camera department.
Now, it looks Samsung is planning to take it to the next level. According to the folks over at GalaxyClub, the Samsung Galaxy S11 is codenamed “Hubble” which refers to the Hubble Space Telescope. Another set of rumours suggests that the Galaxy S11 might come with a periscope camera and include a 5X optical zoom.
If that wasn’t enough to convince you then we have a trademark filed by Samsung with the EUIPO. First spotted by Letsgodigital, the trademark titled “Space Zoom” was registered by Samsung on November 6, 2019. It was categorized as Class 9/42.
The Galaxy S11 is expected to launch somewhere around MWC 2020. We expect Samsung to announce a couple of variants of Galaxy S11 including a 5G model.
