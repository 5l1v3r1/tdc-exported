News of Dell’s dual-screened, foldable Windows 10 device first came to light over a year ago; for which the company has since filed many different patents.
In a new patent, we can see the hinge design which creates a visible gap in the closed state.  The device with the hinge gap is likely to feature a folding screen , similar to Samsung’s folding PC.
Also included in the patent is an alternative hinge design, which allows the laptop to close without a gap:
Here we can see display borders, which move via a roller, and assist in folding and help prevent damage:
The foldable PC is predicted to be released in the second half of 2020 and will include the much anticipated Windows 10X– a version of Windows 10 that has been tailored to dual-screen devices.
