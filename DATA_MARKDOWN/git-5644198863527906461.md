Passengers can do a lot more to stay safe when flying, and avoid or even survive an accident. The programme Why It Matters finds out eight things you should know.
SINGAPORE: Last year was one of the deadliest for the aviation industry in recent years.
The number of people killed in commercial plane crashes jumped by more than 10 times from 50 deaths in 2017 — aviation’s safest year on record — to 514 deaths last year, reported the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
As the year end approaches, safety is always a concern for those getting ready for their holiday overseas.
But statistically speaking, the odds of dying as a plane passenger are low: 1 in 188,364, compared with 1 in 1,117 for drowning and 1 in 103 for a motor vehicle crash, based on 2017 United States census data.
And surviving a plane accident might not be as rare as you think. The European Transport Safety Council categorised 90 per cent of aircraft accidents as survivable in a study in 1996, and airline safety has since improved.
