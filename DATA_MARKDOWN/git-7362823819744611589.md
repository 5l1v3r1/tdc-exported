Activist Jane Fonda visited “The View” on Tuesday, but co-host Meghan McCain was nowhere to be found when the actress, who'd adamantly opposed the Vietnam War, appeared on the ABC News gabfest.
That raised a question: Had McCain refused to appear with Fonda because of her father's service?
McCain’s father, the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, was captured by the North Vietnamese, who tortured and beat him for more than five years after his A4 Skyhawk was hit by a surface-to-air missile over Hanoi in 1967.

Fonda was famously labeled a traitor for her actions during the Vietnam War. During one trip to Vietnam in 1972, she even posed on an anti-aircraft gun, which led her to being nicknamed "Hanoi Jane."  Fonda admitted years later that she regretted sitting on the weapon.
