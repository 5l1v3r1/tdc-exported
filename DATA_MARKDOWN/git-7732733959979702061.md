While companies like Apple seem to be content with 12 megapixel image sensors in their newest smartphones, Xiaomi wants to reignite the megapixel wars. This isn't completely unexpected, as Sony and Samsung have been working hard to bring higher resolution sensors to the market.
Recently, Xiaomi announced its Mi CC9 Pro smartphone in China. Don't let the naming fool you, the device has a penta-camera system on the back, including a 108 megapixel, Isocell Bright HMX sensor that was co-developed with Samsung. There's also a 20 megapixel ultra-wide shooter, a 12 megapixel telephoto for portrait shots, a 5 megapixel one with 5x optical zoom, and a 2 megapixel macro shooter for close-ups.
