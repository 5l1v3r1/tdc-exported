We reported a few days back that Google Chrome developers had agreed to bring back the Close Other Tabs option in the right-click menu in the browser.
Now we are happy to report the feature is back in Chrome Canary, allowing you once again to efficiently dismiss all your open tabs except for the current one you are right-clicking on.
See the old and new options below:
Google had previously also restored the Close Tabs to the Right option. Hopefully the change signals that Google has given up simplifying the Right Click menu and will be concentrating their efforts on more productive areas.
