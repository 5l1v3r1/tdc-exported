Topline: In one of the more prominent punishments laid down by Epic Games, professional player Faze Jarvis has been dealt a lifetime ban from Fortnite after posting videos of himself cheating.
Key Background: Epic has dealt with Fortnite cheaters a few different ways now. Earlier this year, two players were caught colluding during the Fortnite World Cup online qualifiers. Epic banned both for two weeks, but they were still able to collect enough points to qualify for the $30 million tournament held in Queens. In other circumstances, the company has even gone to court against cheaters, last month settling a case against a minor who both posted YouTube videos of cheats and sold cheating software.
Big Number: In 2017, Blizzard Entertainment won an $8.6 million judgment against a cheating software developer, according to Polygon.
