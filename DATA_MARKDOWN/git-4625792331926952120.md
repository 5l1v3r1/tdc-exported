Bill Gates said he remains unsure if he could get Elizabeth Warren to have a conversation with him because of his personal wealth.
In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Conference, Gates explained his criticism of a tax structure that is too liberal and damages the economy.
“I do think if you tax too much, you do risk the capital formation, innovation, ‘U.S. is the desirable place to do innovative companies,’ I do think you risk that,” he said.
Gates acknowledged that he is a “primary beneficiary” of the current tax structure but said he would be concerned if that system changed too much.
“If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” he joked.
He said that he has not spoken to Warren about her proposed wealth tax, but noted that he is not sure she would be willing to speak to him.
