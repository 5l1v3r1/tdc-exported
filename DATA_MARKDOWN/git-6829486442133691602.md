It’s well established that the Melbourne Cup is deeply problematic event for many Australians — often criticised as a vortex of awful combining animal cruelty, binge drinking, and toxic masculinity. So maybe it’s not so surprising that, thanks to Sunrise, a touch of racism has just been added to that mix.
Yep, somehow Sunrise and Channel 7 have managed to code the story of the Melbourne Cup’s winner with deeply xenophobic rhetoric.
The moment came as the panel and guest, Herald Sun journalist Andrew Rule, were discussing the background of the winner, Vow and Declare. Vow and Declare was born in Melbourne, a fact that should mean nothing to anybody, but was incredibly important to the folks over at Sunrise.
“It’s a lovely story,” Rule said. “This is the horse that grew here, not flew here.”
The “grew here, flew here” rhetoric is one that has long been associated with a particularly virulent strain of Australian nationalism. It’s been a rallying call for racists over the years, particularly popular around Australia day, when it is used to other and objectify anyone who isn’t white.
