Former Weezer member Matt Sharp and his band The Rentals have a new double album called Q36 due June 2, 2020, and it looks like it will be a pretty unusual project for The Rentals. Matt made it with Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Nick Zinner on guitar, The Killers’ Ronnie Vannucci on drums, and Flaming Lips collaborator Dave Fridmann as mixing engineer). First single “Spaceships” — which sounds much more like a typical Dave Fridmann collaboration than the last Rentals album — is out now, and the remaining 15 songs will come out over the next few months with one song released every two weeks. Here’s much more background via press release:
