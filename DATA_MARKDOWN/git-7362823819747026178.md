2020 presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg refused to directly say if he would raise taxes on the middle class if elected president, and was challenged on how his plans would affect the deficit, during a Sunday television interview.
"Can you guarantee that a President Pete Buttigieg would not raise taxes on the middle class?" host George Stephanopoulos asked on ABC's "This Week."
"Everything that we have proposed has been paid for, and we have proposed no tax increase on the middle class," he said. "We don’t have to do it in order to deliver these health care solutions. There is a lot of money on the table from loopholes in the corporate tax system from the wealthiest among us who could and should pay more.
"And we don’t have to look to the middle class in order to solve these problems," Buttigieg continued. "But, it also means making sure that we make promises we can keep.”
