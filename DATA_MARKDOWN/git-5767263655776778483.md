The millennium has brought us “millennial” celebrities along with new music genres, but good old rock music is still one of the world’s favorites. While there’s always new rock music to listen to, let’s not forget about the rock stars that were famous in the early 2000s. They may have started to show minor signs of aging, however, that doesn’t mean they’ve stopped rocking our world!
At Bright Side, we’re banging on the drums for our favorite rock stars of the ’00s and getting ready to introduce their modern selves to you.
