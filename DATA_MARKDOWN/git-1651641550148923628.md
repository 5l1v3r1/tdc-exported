Razer today announced the new line-up of Basilisk mice: Razer Basilisk Ultimate and Razer Basilisk X HyperSpeed. Both mice are powered by Razer HyperSpeed technology to offer great wireless performance with the lowest click latency. Another main highlight in both of these mice is their battery life. The Basilisk X HyperSpeed offers the highest battery life (up to 285 hours) in any wireless gaming mouse and the Basilisk Ultimate offers 100 hours battery life.
The new Razer Basilisk Ultimate mouse comes with Focus+ 20K DPI Optical Sensor with support for new features such as Smart Tracking, Asymmetric Cut-Off and Motion Sync for greater tracking accuracy. And it is fitted with Razer Optical Mouse Switches. Like other Razer products, Razer Chroma in this mouse will allow you to customize it with 16 million colors.
