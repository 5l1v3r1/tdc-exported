Bitcoin’s price has been trading around $9,100-$9,500 for a few days after the volatile movements of last week. However, on futures and options exchange Deribit, the price saw a violent red candle, falling to $7,700 in a matter of minutes and causing lots of losses. The company stated today that it would reimburse all affected users.
The issue was noted around 21:00 UTC on October 31st, and it reportedly affected many users on the exchange. The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap flash-crashed to $7,700 in mere minutes, causing significant losses for traders.
The company was quick to react, saying that it would be reimbursing customers to the tune of $1.3 million. It added that “the Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit.”
Just a few hours ago, the exchange confirmed that approximately 150 BTC had been issued to affected users.
