NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi on Wednesday refused to admit that he has been replaced as captain of India for the Davis Cup tie against Pakistan saying he is available and believes he is "still captain".
The All India Tennis Association on Monday named Rohit Rajpal, a former India player and chairman of the national tennis federation's selection panel, as the non-playing captain after Bhupathi also refused to travel to Pakistan citing security concerns for the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I tie.
"To everyone so concerned for my thoughts and comments. All I know is from a phone call with Mr. Chatterjee (AITA Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee) on Monday where I was told that Rohit is replacing me as captain because I wasn't comfortable going to Pakistan (love the country been there before - not this time)," Bhupathi tweeted.
