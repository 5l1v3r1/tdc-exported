Topline: Collins English dictionary has named “climate strike” its word of 2019, continuing a trend of recognizing environmentally-linked phrases after “single-use” was chosen last year.
Crucial quote: “These are strange, anxiety-inducing times—but there are reasons to be cheerful. That’s what the English language seems to be telling us in 2019. Having trawled websites, newspapers, magazines, social media, and everyday conversations, Collins’ lexicographers have detected an uptick in words linked to both environmental and digital derangement—as well as ones linked to fighting back,” Collins said in a statement.
Key background: Usage of the word “climate strike” exploded in the last year partially thanks to protests around the world inspired by Swedish student and climate activist Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion campaign group.
