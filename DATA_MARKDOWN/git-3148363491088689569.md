ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers released a Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions Report on November 1 revealing 25 criminal aliens who are currently incarcerated in the Wake County, North Carolina, jail and who could be released by sanctuary county officials despite immigration detainers being issued. The report includes incarcerated migrants with charges of murder, sexual assault, sexual assault of children, drug trafficking, assault, and armed robbery.
The Wake County jail has a history of releasing criminal aliens with immigration detainers. ICE officials “repeatedly asked local jurisdictions to reconsider non-cooperation policies because those policies put politics before public safety.”
“The only way a person is subject to an ICE detainer in Wake County is if they are handcuffed and arrested for a crime committed in the local community,” said acting ICE Director Matt Albence. “These misguided policies protect criminals, not the immigrant communities they were created to protect.”
