Facebook on Monday unveiled a new logo to represent the Silicon Valley company, distinct from its core social network.
The move aims to highlight the Facebook “brand” which operates a range of apps and services including messaging, photo-sharing, virtual reality and is developing wallets for digital currency.
The new branding, basically the company name in crisp lettering, will be stamped on its “family” of offerings including WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra, according to chief marketing officer Antonio Lucio.
“Today, we’re updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook,” Lucio said.
