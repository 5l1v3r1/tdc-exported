The Pixel 4 and 4 XL have already been in the hands of reviewers and customers for a while now. With the first real-word reports coming up, we were stunned to see huge discrepancies between battery usage statistics and ominous 60Hz screen refresh rate lock-ins for some people who seemingly couldn't get the 90Hz Smooth Display mode working. A recent finding shines light into the issue: The display only switches to 90Hz with a screen brightness set above 75%.
A Reddit user noticed his Pixel 4 turned off Smooth Display at this arbitrary threshold when they monitored logs via ADB. Our own Artem Russakovskii and XDA Developer's Mishaal Rahman could confirm this with their phones.
