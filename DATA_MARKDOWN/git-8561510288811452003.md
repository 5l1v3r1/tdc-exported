The close confines of a drive-thru lane apparently mess with Teslas’ parking sensors, resulting in a cacophony of annoying beeps and alarms.
Parking sensors can help drivers avoid annoying dings and dangerous collisions as they try to back into a spot. But now Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he’s looking into providing the option to turn them off, Business Insider reports, to spare hungry drivers from annoyance as they wait for a burger.
Musk’s announcement comes after someone complained to him on Twitter about the noise her car makes while detecting hazards in the drive-thru lane. Musk replied: “Looking into it.”
