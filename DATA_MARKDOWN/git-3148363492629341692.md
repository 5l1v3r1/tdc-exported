Whitehead posted his ill-advised reply to sports reporter Dustin Fox who was critical of the player’s tackling during the Brown’s loss to the Denver Broncos.
Replying to Fox’s claim that Whitehead’s effort at tackling was “a joke,” the player went on a rant filled with threats and name calling.
“Come get it in blood bitch made ass lil boy,” Whitehead tweeted. “I’m out there with a broken hand. Don’t get smoked fuck ass cracker.”
