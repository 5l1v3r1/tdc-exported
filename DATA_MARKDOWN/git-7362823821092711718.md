Actresses Jane Fonda, Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Keener have been arrested for protesting in the Hart Senate Building.
The protest was part of Fonda's "Fire Drill Friday" campaign, which includes Washington, D.C., protests drawing attention to climate change politics.
This is the fourth protest of the series. Fonda has been arrested each time, and actors Ted Danson and Sam Waterston have been arrested in previous weeks.

Friday's protest included the crowd singing "We Shall Not Be Moved" and "This Land Is Your Land," alongside chants favoring the Green New Deal.
Fonda, 81, was seen wearing the same bright red coat that she's worn to each protest; she promised the crowd that it was the last piece of clothing she'd ever buy.
