The stand-up comedian and The Secret Life of Pets 2 star has faced a barrage of social media harassment after he replied to Sen. Sanders’ (I-VT) demand on Twitter that “we need a national rent control standard now.”
“Wrong,” Hannibal Buress replied in a tweet that has since been deleted. He also tweeted a link to a landlords’ rights group.
The comedian’s one-word reply unleashed a torrent of online mudslinging that focused on the fact that Buress is a property owner in Chicago.
The Chicago Tribune reported two years ago that Buress “works as a landlord because he rents out units of his Chicago building on Airbnb.”
Among the online harassers was Live Science writer Rafi Letzter, who replied to Buress by snarkily demanding to know “how much is appropriate to tip your landlord do you think.” Letzter encouraged his social media followers to “ruin a landlord’s day,” linking to a tenants’ activism site.
