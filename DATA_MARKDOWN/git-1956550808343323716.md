What is Afterlife? The venue describes itself as a gastropub, the staff describe the menu as Turkish with an Indian twist – 90 percent Turkish and ten percent Indian to be exact – but there’s also Japanese and Italian dishes on the menu. Hmm.Dishes range from chicken wings “done the Turkish way”, mushroom risotto with truffle, biryanis, pide (a Turkish flatbread) topped with chicken tikka, mezze  such as falafel and kibbeh, salads from fattoush to caprese, and a selection sushi rolls.And the mish-mash doesn’t end with the menu. With its cave-like interior, antler chandeliers, red leather sofas, big DJ booth, wall panels with Egyptian hieroglyphics, futuristic-looking light fixtures and random photos hanging from the ceiling, the décor is as baffling as the menu.But maybe that’s the charm? After all, Dubai is made up of more than 200 nationalities and Afterlife is seemingly trying to appeal to as many as possible.We order the muhammara and cheese pide and the akami tuna sushi rolls. Not your usual combination but when in Rome (or Turkey, India or Japan) right?Both dishes are well-presented and the cheese pide hits with the spot, with a spicy kick.The views are the one thing you can rely on, with an excellent position by The Dubai Fountains.The rest of it leaves us somewhat perplexed.WHAT IS IT...A completely random mix of different cultures and aestheticsWHY GO...Those Insta-worthy views…
