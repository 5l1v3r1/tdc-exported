MADISON, Wis. - The second of two bands of snow that have affected southern Wisconsin is moving through Wednesday evening.
Only minor additional accumulation is expected, but with temperatures below freezing, untreated roads and bridges could be slippery, and visibility may be reduced by the falling snow.
Once the snow ends later Wednesday night, skies will clear and our weather will turn unseasonably cold. The new snow cover will allow temperatures to fall to between 20 and 25 degrees below normal through much of next week, with the exception of a brief moderation in temperatures Saturday. A cold front passing through Wisconsin will cause temperatures to drop again during the day Sunday.
