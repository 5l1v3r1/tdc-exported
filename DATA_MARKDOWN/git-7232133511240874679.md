The Bitcoin (BTC) price is once again in a lull-like state, having seen barely any bouts of volatility over the past few days. Due to this, trend indicators have begun to tighten, as has volume, signaling to many that volatility is inbound.
While this impending bout of volatility could easily bring BTC back down to the $8,000s, potentially in a move that may establish new multi-month lows, analysts are currently leaning bullish on Bitcoin, having observed a confluence of positive technical signals that imply upward continuation.
Popular Twitter analyst Crypto Thies recently noted that Bitcoin is currently looking rather positive as the volume moving average implies incoming volatility. In the chart below, he showed that when BTC bottomed at $7,300, it bounced decisively off the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the move from $3,000 to $14,000, which correlates with the two-week volume-weighted moving average.
