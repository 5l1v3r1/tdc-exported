        Katie Taylor is a two-weight world champion.
      
The Bray boxer achieved the feat with victory over Christina Linardatou in Manchester on Saturday night. After already cementing her legacy as the undisputed lightweight world champion, Taylor added the WBO super lightweight title to her impressive collection.
The 2012 Olympic champion recorded her win via unanimous decision after a typically composed performance. Her professional record now reads 15-0.
Taylor had the spectators at the Manchester Arena on their feet before the first bell rang.
