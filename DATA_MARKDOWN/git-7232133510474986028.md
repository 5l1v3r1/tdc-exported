Ethereum (ETH) has been caught in a bout of consolidation within the mid-$180 region, which has been largely guided by Bitcoin’s inability to garner any momentum that pushes it away from the lower-$9,000 region, which is where it has been trading for the past several days.
Now, analysts are noting that ETH may be positioned for a retrace towards $170 in the near-term as it also faces an ongoing decline in on-chain volume.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up 2% at its current price of $185, which marks a slight climb from its recent lows of $177 that were set last week.
It is important to note that Ethereum has been caught in a trading range between roughly $180 and $190 over the past several weeks, which is largely the result of Bitcoin’s bout of consolidation between $9,000 and $9,500.
Regardless of how Bitcoin trades in the near-term, Ethereum may soon incur a downside movement that takes it as low as $170, which is where its “golden fib ratio” currently exists.
The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained this possibility in a recent tweet, noting that ETH’s near-term target exists at $176, while its mid-term target exists at $170.
