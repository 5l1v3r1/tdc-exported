        New Delhi (Sputnik): The controversial Pakistani pop singer earlier made headlines after threatening to set her snakes and alligator on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while criticising New Delhi’s decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
      
Rabi Pirzada, a Pakistani pop singer and TV host, has announced her decision to quit showbusiness after her nude pictures and videos were leaked online on Friday.
She became one of the top trends in Pakistan for more than 24 hours following the lewd leak, and even though the clips have now been taken down, they remained on public display for over a day.
The pop singer took to Twitter today to announce that she's leaving the entertainment industry while seeking forgiveness from God. She also urged people to keep her in their hearts despite her recording the explicit videos.
“I, Rabi Pirzada am quitting showbiz. May Allah forgive my sins. And soften the hearts of people in my favour,” read her tweet in Urdu.
