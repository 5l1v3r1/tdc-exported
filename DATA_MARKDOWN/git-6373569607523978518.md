Plymouth Argyle's League Two game against Grimsby Town at Home Park this afternoon is 'in jeopardy' due to damage to the roof in parts of Home Park.
Club officials and safety experts are carrying out an assessment to see if repairs can be made in time.
A club statement released at 11.30am read: "The overnight severe winds in Plymouth have caused significant damage to the roof in parts of Home Park.
The health and safety of supporters is, of paramount importance and we are currently assessing the situation, along with safety experts, to see if we can make good the damage.
However, with continuing bad weather forecast, this might not be possible, regrettably placing this afternoonâ€™s Sky Bet League Two game against Grimsby Town in jeopardy. We will keep supporters updated."
The Grimsby squad made the 350-mile trip from Humberside yesterday.
