Peralta made the announcement while meeting law school deans during the first day of the 2019 Bar exams at the University of Santo Tomas.
Hosaka was appointed spokesman and PIO chief by retired chief justice Lucas Bersamin last January replacing Court Administrator Jose Midas Marquez who at that time, held the post in an acting capacity.
Prior to his designation, Hosaka was a founding partner of the Paner Hosaka & Ypil Attorneys-at-Law. He also served as Deputy General Counsel of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
He obtained his AB Interdisciplinary Studies (Merit Scholar) and Juris Doctor degrees from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1993 and 1998, respectively.
