        Following earlier reports about the new appointment of Pat Fry, the Renault F1 team have confirmed the news themselves. Fry, who worked with McLaren until the middle of the year, will join the French team once his contractual agreements are over. 
      
Marcin Budkowski, the executive director of the Renault F1 team, said the following about this in the press release on the team's site: “I am delighted to be able to work with Pat again. His arrival is yet another step as we build and improve our team structure. Pat’s experience, talent and determination will be additional assets as we continue our progress.”
The delay is because a team member can't leave and then join another team immediately because they might be able to transfer valuable knowledge.
