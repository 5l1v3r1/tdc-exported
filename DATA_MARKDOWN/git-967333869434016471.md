        The US began withdrawing troops and equipment from positions in northern Syria last month, after Turkey kicked off its (since halted) military operation against Syrian Kurdish militias. But President Trump has also indicated that the US will continue to host “some” troops in eastern Syria, with the goal of “keeping” the war-torn country’s oil.
      
The Syrian Arab News Agency has published new footage it says shows a large convoy of US military vehicles being withdrawn from Syria into Iraq.
