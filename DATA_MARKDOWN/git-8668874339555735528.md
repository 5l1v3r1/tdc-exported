Exeter Chief’s controversial use of a ruck loophole has come in for heavy criticism online, with many suggesting the practice should be banned.
The Chiefs deployed the tactic in their 24-20 Gallagher Premiership victory over Worcester Warriors in Sixways, and it didn’t go unnoticed on Twitter.
The ‘ladder rucking’ technique sees players attaching to a ruck to form a single line of consecutive players, one after the next.
The technique effectively means the hind most of foot of the ruck is several metres away from the nearest opposition player, and thus give halfbacks space and time to kick at their leisure, sure in the knowledge defenders haven’t a chance of effecting a tackle.
An image of the loophole was posted by Chris Clarkson on Twitter. He wrote: “The sooner this ludicrous loop hole gets taken out of the game the better. Looks ridiculous.”
