The bones of a massive sea creature have been found in a cornfield in Krzyzanowice, near the Swietokrzyskie Mountains in Poland, the discoverers of the remains told Science in Poland in an interview.
According to the paleontologists, the fossils found belong to a pliosaur - a 30-foot long and several tons heavy extinct reptile of the late Jurassic period.
Fossils of that kind are the first to ever be found in Poland, the researchers said. 
The findings of the Polish scientists have been published in the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association scientific journal.
Earlier in December, another 180-million-year-old ''sea monster'' from the Jurassic era, with skin and blubber, was found by researchers from North Carolina State University and Sweden's Lund University. The creature is said to look like a modern dolphin and actually belong to a type of marine reptiles called an ichthyosaur.
