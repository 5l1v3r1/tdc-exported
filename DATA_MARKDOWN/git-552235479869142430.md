Scott McKenna will return to Steve Clarke’s Scotland squad as the manager attempts to stiffen up his defence ahead of the Euro 2020 playoffs.
The Aberdeen centre-back will be named as part of Clarke’s latest travelling party for this month’s final dead rubber of a double header in Cyprus and at home to Kazakhstan.
Clarke axed veteran Charlie Mulgrew last time out for a win over San Marino after blaming the Blackburn man for the 4-0 rout Scotland suffered against Russia in Moscow.
Kilmarnock’s Stuart Findlay, who is currently injured, and McKenna’s Aberdeen team-mate Mikey Devlin were paired up in the centre of Clarke’s defence for that 6-0 thrashing against the Group I whipping boys at Hampden.
But with McKenna now getting back to fitness and form at Pittodrie the 22-year-old looks set to be fast-tracked straight back into Clarke’s starting line-up.
Keeper Liam Kelly is in contention for a recall after cementing his place at QPR.
The former Livingston and Rangers keeper has played in the last six Championship matches for Mark Warburton’s side.
