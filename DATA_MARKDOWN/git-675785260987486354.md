Manchester United are back in business.
After a torrid season to date, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stopped the rot with three consecutive away wins.
Victories at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea and eased pressure on the under-fire boss.
But a trip to Bournemouth is a different prospect, with United struggling at the Vitality Stadium in recent years.
Bournemouth are a tough nut to crack and only have one defeat in their last six Premier League outings - and only conceded one goal in the whole of last month.
