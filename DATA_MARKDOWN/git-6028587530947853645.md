(Updated: 11/12/19 at 10:04 a.m. PST)Topline: Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed paperwork on Tuesday to appear on the 2020 presidential primary ballot in Arkansas, taking the first steps in a bid to become a centrist alternative to progressives Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
Key background: Michael Bloomberg cofounded financial information and media company Bloomberg LP in 1981. He put in the seed funding for the company and now owns 88% of the business, which has estimated revenues of $10 billion. According to Forbes, Bloomberg’s net worth is $52 billion.
Tangent: Bloomberg isn’t the only one considering a last-ditch presidential run as moderate Democrats in the party worry about their chances in a general election if a more liberal candidate gets the nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick is also exploring a presidential bid, believing that he would be able to unite the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic party.
