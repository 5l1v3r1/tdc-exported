In a statement issued by Meralco yesterday electricity rates will be P0.4717 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), translating to an increase of P94.34 for a typical household consuming 200 kWh.
The upward adjustment brought the overall household rate this month to P9.5579 per kWh from P9.0862 per kWh.
This is the second straight month that the power distributor raised power rates.
Despite the increase, November rate is still P1 lower than Aprilâ€™s rate of P10.56 per kWh, the company said.
Higher WESM charges lead to overall generation charge increase; from P4.5406 per kWh last month, the generation charge for November increased to P5.0317 per kWh, an upward adjustment of P0.4911 per kWh.
Charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) increased by P3.8016 per kWh driven by tighter supply conditions in the Luzon grid. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) placed the grid on Yellow Alert last October 14 and 15 due to forced outages of several power plants and the maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya natural gas facility from October 12 to 15.
