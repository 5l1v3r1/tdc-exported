        **Spoilers for 'Watchmen' episode three below**
      
Watchmen switched gears and swapped perspectives this week. In the first two episodes we were very much in the pocket of small town police work, but in episode three we got a cynical outsider’s look at the case of the hanged police chief. Angela Abar aka Sister Night was pushed to the periphery, with Laurie Blake aka Silk Spectre taking centre stage, a reformed vigilante now working high up in the FBI, who was dispatched to Tulsa to investigate Crawford’s death.
This was the episode that really started to convey the satire at the heart of Alan Moore‘s Watchmen comics, Blake ridiculing masked vigilantes big and small, notorious and amateur. Checking her teeth for errant fragments of food in Looking Glass’ reflective hood and relentlessly mocking the superhero-enamoured assistant she was sent to Tulsa with, it was a cathartic watch after more than a decade of superhero content that expects you to take its premise deadly seriously (here’s looking at you, Marvel).
