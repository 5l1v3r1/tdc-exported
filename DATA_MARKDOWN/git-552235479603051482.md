A thief threatened a Bellshill shopkeeper with a knife and screwdriver before making off with two crates of beer.
The staff member at McColl's store on Calder Road refused to hand over the cash after the brazen robber threatened them at around 3.30pm on Sunday, November 3.
The suspect then left with two crates of beer and headed off in the direction of Rosevale Crescent .
He is described as male, of heavy build, wearing a dark hooded bubble style jacket with his hood up, denim jeans and brown boots.
Detective constable Gerry Hattie, of Wishaw CID , said: “The victim was uninjured as a result of this incident but has been left shaken.
“We are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the robbery or may have seen a man matching this description.
“Anyone who has any information can contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 2572 of 3 November 2019."
