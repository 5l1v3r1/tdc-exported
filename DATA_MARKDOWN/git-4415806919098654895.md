Members of the Irish Medical Organisation have voted unanimously in favour of holding a ballot for industrial action.
They said the action taken may be "up to and including strike action".
It follows a meeting of consultants and doctors this evening, amid the ongoing recruitment and retention row.
The group is seeking pay parity for those recruited after October 2012 and improved working conditions.
