Marc McKenzie produced the thrills to inspire Hurlford United to victory over Shotts in their Junior Cup replay yesterday.
The former Albion Rovers and Cowdenbeath forward set up two goals and hit the post himself as his side marched into the fourth round.
Goals from Chris Robertson and Lewis Morrison put the West Premiership big guns in control and while Jordon Love pulled one back, Jack Whittaker clinched it for the hosts in the second half.
