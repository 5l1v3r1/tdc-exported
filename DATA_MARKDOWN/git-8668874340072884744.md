The conjecture in the lead up to the bronze play-off match in Tokyo was that nobody wanted to play the game and nobody was too interested in the result.
It’s a good thing that the game did go ahead, however, as fans were treated to an array of easy-on-the-eye tries. It was also an important match to send off a number of the All Blacks’ stalwarts who were playing their final Test match.
New Zealand led the game from start to finish after scoring in the first five minutes and were good value for their 40-17 win. Who were the All Blacks’ best performers in their final game under the control of Steve Hansen? RugbyPass rates the players:
Showed good gas to score a well-taken try, running 20-odd metres. Continued an excellent run of matches for the All Blacks, in both attack, defence and in the set-piece. Off in 56th minute.
Busy early on defence. Not really sighted on attack before he had to take his leave in the 25th minute.
