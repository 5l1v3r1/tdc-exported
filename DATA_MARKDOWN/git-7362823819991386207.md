An aircraft with El Al Isreal Airlines just “drew” what is probably the largest self-portrait ever created.
El Al, Israel’s national carrier, paid tribute to its soon-to-be-retired fleet of Boeing 747s by outlining the shape of the popular plane in the sky over the Mediterranean, as seen in a diagram of its flight path.

The Nov. 3 flight, which departed from Rome and landed in Tel Aviv, diverted just west of Cyprus and lowered its cruising altitude by 10,000 feet before starting its plane-shaped flight path, Business Insider reported.
The outline itself appears nearly as wide as the island of Cyprus; a legend provided at FlightAware24 indicates it measured over 100 miles long.
