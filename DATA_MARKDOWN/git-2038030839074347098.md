Cape Town – Rolanda Marais goes from housewife to gun-toting badass in M-Net's new big-budget TV show, Trackers.
In this, the third episode of Channel24's podcast series The Interview, we meet Rolanda (Milla Strachan) one cold winter night in the Mother City on the set of the crime drama. An empty dock at the Waterfront turns into a war zone with bullets flying and cameras rolling as we get a peek behind-the-scenes of the show.
Deon Meyer’s new TV drama Trackers airs Sundays at 20:00 on M-Net (DStv 101) and is also available on Showmax.
