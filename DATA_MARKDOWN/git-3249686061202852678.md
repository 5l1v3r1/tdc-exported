Former MONSTA X member Wonho has the top three trends worldwide on Twitter as fans speak out against his contract termination with Starship Entertainment.

The hashtags, #FightForWonho, #StarshipWeWantAnAnswer, and #WeSupportMONSTAX have been used by global and Korean fans alike to express their thoughts on this matter.
