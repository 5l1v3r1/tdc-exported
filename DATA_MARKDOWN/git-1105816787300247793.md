KARACHI: Bass guitarist and composer Sohaib Lari was comfortably seated on a sofa in his cool and cosy studio space in Karachi. He, along with Hamad Khan, formed the duo that founded Bigfoot Music – an upcoming studio and virtual space focusing exclusively on original content.
“Our industry lacks original music,” Lari told The Express Tribune as he sipped on his cup of tea. “We are not interested in covers; everyone is doing them. We are looking for artists who have found their own rhythm so that we can make others groove to it.”
