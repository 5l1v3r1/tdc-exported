PETALING JAYA, Nov 5 — Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves set tongues wagging when he walked down the red carpet hand-in-hand with artist Alexandra Grant recently.
The pair were attending the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles on Saturday.
Various publications reported that it was the first time Reeves has ever attended a red carpet event with a date throughout his 35-year career.
Their public display of affection fueled the curiosity of fans who couldn’t help but wonder if Reeves, affectionately nicknamed the “internet’s boyfriend”, was dating Grant for real.
Either way, many social media users were over the moon to see the 55-year-old with a companion they deemed to be “age-appropriate”.
Various publications have reported Grant’s age as 46 years old.
