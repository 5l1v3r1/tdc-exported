A witness reportedly heard the still-publicly unidentified attacker telling Ho he “must pay with [his] life” for his ties to pro-China thugs responsible for a mass attack on unarmed protesters in July. Reporters caught Ho shaking hands and chatting with several communist attackers following the brutal beating of dozens of protesters on their way home from an event in Yuen Long.
Ho appeared on a video from the hospital in Chinese state media saying he only suffered a two-centimeter-deep wound and that he believes he will make a swift recovery. In addition to this attack, an unknown group vandalized the tombs of Ho’s parents following his appearance alongside the pro-China thugs in July.
The attack on Ho follows a gruesome incident this weekend in which a pro-communist man speaking Mandarin – a main language in Beijing but not Hong Kong, where most speak Cantonese – bit off the ear of pro-democracy district councilman Andrew Chiu.
The Global Times, a communist state media outlet, published a video of Ho’s stabbing in full:.
