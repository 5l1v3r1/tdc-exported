COLERAIN TOWNSHIP, Ohio â€” A police department in suburban Cincinnati says they have received startling reports of metal objects "similar to razor blades" hidden inside trick-or-treat candy.
In a tweet, the Colerain Police Department announced that "objects reported to be metal and similar to razor blades" were found in candy from the Pleasant Run area.
Colerain Township police confirmed two separate families reported finding blades in the candy. One blade was found in a Reese's peanut butter cup, the other in a Kit-Kat bar.
Authorities are currently investigating the reports.
"We want to stress the importance of parents checking their child's candy for any signs of tampering," police said.
