An Alert Day is in the forecast for Wednesday morning.  A clipper type system will move across the northern tier of the US, bringing some light snow to southern Wisconsin. 
The snow will develop late tonight and continue into Wednesday morning.  The heaviest snow will fall between 3-9 AM Wednesday.  The snow may mix with rain before coming to an end by midday Wednesday.  The latest forecast models are bringing up to 4" of new snow to the area.  Stay up to date with the forecast as small changes in the track of this storm may impact snow amounts.
Another blast of cold air will arrive for the end of the week.  High temperatures will only be in the 20s with overnight lows falling to the teens.  A second arctic blast will arrive on Sunday, dropping temperatures even more for the start of next week.
