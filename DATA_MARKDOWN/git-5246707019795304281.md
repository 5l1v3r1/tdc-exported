At the beginning of yesterday's Terry Bogard showcase, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate game director Masahiro Sakurai spoke in detail about the history of the character, including the system he started out on and the series he's featured in over the years.
Mr. Sakurai even revealed his favourite games that Terry features in. These titles include Fatal Fury Special and The King of Fighters '95 – although he considers the The King of Fighters '98 to offer the "ultimate" strategic experience.
If you're perhaps eager to see what these games are like for yourself, you'll be pleased to hear the Switch eShop currently has select Arcade Archives Neo Geo games on sale for half price until 20th November. In particular, many games from the King of Fighters and Fatal Fury series. Take a look below:
Unfortunately, the game Sakurai gave the most praise – KoF '98 – is not on sale. If you really want it though, it'll set you back $7.99 / £6.29.
