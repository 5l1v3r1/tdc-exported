"The Daily Show" host Trevor Noah mocked the right-wing conspiracies surrounding the Clintons, jokingly asking Hillary Clinton how she managed to kill Jeffrey Epstein.
"I have to ask you a question that has been plaguing me for a while: How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?” Noah asked in the Comedy Central interview on Thursday.
The question drew a laugh from Clinton, who was appearing alongside her daughter, Chelsea, to promote their new book. Noah said the former presidential candidate has been a "boogeyman" for the right-wing, questioning why some believe she has so much power.

“Because you’re not in power but you have all the power. I really need to understand how you do what you do, because you seem to be behind everything nefarious, and yet you do not use it to become president," he said.
