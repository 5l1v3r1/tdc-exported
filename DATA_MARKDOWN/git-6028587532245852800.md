Topline: Apple entered the streaming wars with much fanfare on Friday, announcing the launch of Apple TV+ as the first “all-original” streaming service, with a slate of high-budget new shows that it hopes can compete with rivals like Amazon, Netflix and Disney.
Tangent: A recent study of the new streaming landscape found that after Disney+ (88%), Apple TV+ had the highest levels of consumer awareness (63%), followed by HBO Max (37%)—slated for release in Spring 2020, and NBCU’s Peacock (28%)—releasing in April 2020.
Big number: In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analysts see big potential for Apple TV+, estimating that it could generate $9 billion per year in revenue by 2025—and that’s if just one out of every ten Apple users subscribes to the new service.
Crucial quote: “It’s a gift to our users and, from a business point of view, we’re really proud of the content,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said after the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. We think it’s a bold move.”
