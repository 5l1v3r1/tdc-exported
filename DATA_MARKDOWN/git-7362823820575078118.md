New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins was roasted on social media Monday during a game against the Dallas Cowboys.
The one particular play Jenkins was catching heat for his effort, or lack thereof, trying to tackle Cowboys tight end Blake Jarwin as he rumbled into the end zone. Jarwin caught a pass from quarterback Dak Prescott and broke a few tackles to score.

Jenkins appeared to be frozen in time and stuck his arm out as Jarwin zipped by him.
