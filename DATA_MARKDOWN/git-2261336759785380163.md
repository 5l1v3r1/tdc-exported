The official weigh-ins for UFC 244 are complete, and nearly everyone made weight. I say “nearly” because Jennifer Maia for the second time running has come in over the flyweight limit. Her bout vs. Katlyn Chookagian will now be at a 127 lbs catchweight, but this is a hammer blow for Maia’s title shot aspirations.
As for the headliners, Nate Diaz weighed in at 170.4 lbs to Jorge Masvidal’s 169.6 lbs, making the BMF title official. Despite the delayed trip to the USA due to visa issues, Darren Till arrived in New York and made the non-title middleweight limit of 186 lbs. Kelvin Gastelum? Ehhhh things were a bit shady.
