LAHORE: Former premier Nawaz Sharif and daughter Maryam Nawaz arrived at Jati Umra alongside Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday.
Nawaz, who was discharged on Tuesday from the hospital, refused to be moved to Raiwind at the eleventh hour because Maryam had not been released from the prison despite the submission of surety bonds and passport to the court.
The 69-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) supremo was first taken to the government-run hospital last month after his health deteriorated.
Nawaz was granted bail on medical grounds by the Lahore High Court (LHC) in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) investigation pertaining to Chaudhry Sugar Mills, and the Islamabad High Court granted an eight-week suspension of his seven-year sentence awarded by accountability court judge Arshad Malik in the Al Azizia Hill Metal Establishment corruption reference.
PML-N Spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb stated that the three-time prime minister will not be treated at Sharif Medical Complex. He will be treated at the Raiwind residence where an ICU unit has been established under the supervision of the former premier’s personal physician Dr Adnan Malik.
