El Salvador's government has announced the expulsion of Venezuela's diplomatic corps and given them 48 hours to leave the country.
In a statement shared by President Nayib Bukele on Twitter on Sunday, the government explained the decision aimed to be coherent with previous declarations of Bukele where he has "repeatedly" not recognised the legitimacy of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.
The statement said the Salvadoran government recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president "until free elections are held".
El Salvador would receive new diplomatic representatives named by Guaido, the government added.
"In the near future, El Salvador awaits the receipt of credentials for Venezuela's new diplomatic representation", the statement said.
A number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Colombia and Chile, recognised Guaido as Venezuela's leader after he declared himself interim president in January, saying that Maduro's re-election was illegitimate.
