Well, this was always inevitable. In a new short documentary from the BBC (via PC Gamer) that chronicled Death Stranding's development in the final days of its production, Hideo Kojima revealed that his studio would indeed create films at some point.
"In the future, Kojima Productions will start making films," Kojima said. "If you can do one thing well, then you can do everything well."
