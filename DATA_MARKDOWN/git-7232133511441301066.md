The bitcoin price climbed by more than 40 percent after China’s President Xi Jinping endorsed blockchain technology in his speech on October 25. Global outlets were quick to correlate the two events, stating that investors [probably] increased their holdings in bitcoin, hoping that the Chinese people would also do the same by taking cues from Jinping’s blockchain support.
But, according to market analyst Alex Krüger, the benchmark cryptocurrency will have a difficult time attracting the Chinese population. The economist on Sunday noted that bitcoin corrected by as much as 14 percent after the last week’s price rally. And it has since trended horizontally, slowed down by less-than-expected volume. The price action does not prove that the Chinese are coming to bag bitcoin anytime soon.
