The 2019 LEGO Harry Potter advent calendar is here!
This years set includes Harry and Hedqig, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, Professor Flitwick, and a "Hogwarts Architect" and a micro Hogwarts Express train amongst the many treats.
I wonder what the Jewish wizards and witches do for Hannukah? My daughter likes the Star Wars advent set.
