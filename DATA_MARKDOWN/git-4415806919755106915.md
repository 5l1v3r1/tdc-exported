Reese Witherspoon has spoken of the gratitude she feels towards women who spoke out about sexual harassment and abuse they received to spark the Me Too movement and the responsibility she felt to do them justice.
The Oscar winner stars opposite Jennifer Aniston in the new Apple TV+ series The Morning Show, about a breakfast television programme in the throes of a sexual harassment scandal, reminiscent of the public fall from grace of Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show in the US.
Arriving at a special screening of the show in London, she told the PA news agency: “I’m enormously grateful to the women who spoke up and exposed the harassment and the hostile work environments that they have experienced.
“It really felt like a responsibility that we had to help tell those stories but also to reveal the human side of it.
