CINCINNATI – A Dayton Police Department officer who was shot Monday night during a search warrant execution was taken into surgery to donate his organs Thursday morning and died afterward, according to a statement made by police.
Detective Jorge DelRio remained on advanced life support as of Wednesday, the department said. He suffered injuries during the shooting that "are tragically not survivable."
Hundreds of officers gathered at Grandview Hospital in Dayton to honor the detective Thursday morning, Chief Richard Biehl said. Funeral arrangements will be announced next week.
"We have not even begun to adjust to a professional or personal life that does not include Jorge's presence," Biehl said. "That is even truer for his family, friends, loved ones who were blessed to know Jorge and to benefit from his warm and generous spirit."
Mayor of Dayton Nan Whaley tweeted: "I'm heartbroken that Officer Jorge DelRio has passed away after injuries sustained in the line of duty earlier this week. Since then, we've heard countless stories about what he meant to his family, his colleagues, and his community."
