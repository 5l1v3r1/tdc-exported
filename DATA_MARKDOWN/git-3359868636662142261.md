It’s a great moment of cheer for all cryptocurrency miners carrying out operations based out of China. In the latest development, the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has decided to withdraw its proposal of banning crypto-mining activities (including Bitcoin mining) taking place in the country.
On Wednesday, November 5, the NDRC published a new catalog for Guiding Industry Restructuring. The new version replaces the earlier one created in 2011 wherein the agency had proposed banning the crypto mining activities in China.
