2020 presidential candidate and self-admitted Democratic socialist Bernard Sanders said Saturday he rejects the notion that his proposals are “far left.”
“My ideas are not far left, they are the ideas that the American people want,” the Vermont senator told a crowd at the Iowa NAACP’s Economic Freedom town hall, according to a video taken at the event.
Mr. Sanders, who is polling at about 17% nationally, has proposed far-reaching policies that most moderates would consider extreme, including guaranteed housing, tuition-free college and free health care for illegal immigrants.
It’s not the first time the senator has denied being a fat-left candidate. In September, he told Cosmopolitan, “You know, the media will sometimes describe me as ‘far left,’ but honestly, I don’t accept that moniker. Because if you look at the issues that I talk about, they are supported by the American people. I have led the effort in this country with some success to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that a radical idea? I don’t think so. Overwhelming support for that among the American people.”
