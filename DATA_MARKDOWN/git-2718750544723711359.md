Most of ABC’s somewhat-live production of The Little Mermaid Tuesday night was actually very much not live and just footage from the original animated movie. But maybe that is for the best because what we saw on screen was — how do we put this nicely? — summoned from the depths of hell. While humans played most of the main characters during the movie’s songs (Auli’i Cravalho, not a soprano, tried her best at Ariel; Queen Latifah was a great Ursula, of course) there were a few that ended up either not being seen at all (Triton, too hunky to live, was cut) or just appeared as puppets. Poor Flounder, such a cute little fish, did not deserve the curse of transforming into the horrifying, flap-lipped creature that “danced” next to Ariel. Maybe it’s best to let a few tweets get the gist of things across.
