Topline: Billionaire Travis Kalanick’s secretive new food startup, CloudKitchens, quietly raised $400 million from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund—the Saudi’s first known deal in Silicon Valley since the murder of American journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year caused numerous investors to boycott Saudi funding, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
Tangent: Meanwhile, over at Uber, things aren’t looking great. The ride-sharing company’s latest quarterly earnings report was far from stellar, showing losses of over $1 billion. The stock has struggled to gain footing since going public in May, and shares plunged further thanks to the post-IPO lockup period—which prevents early investors from selling shares—expiring yesterday. Uber stock hit a new low of less than $26 per share, down from its IPO price of $45 per share.
Crucial statistic: Kalanick, who still owns 4% of Uber and remains a director on its board, has a net worth of $3.2 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates.
Key background: Kalanick, who founded Uber in 2009, was ousted as CEO in 2017 after a series of scandals rocked the ride-sharing company.
