As reported by PC Gamer, it’s already possible to download the first Red Dead Redemption 2 mod, even though it’s still a few hours before the game launches (at the time of writing). The ‘Arthur Morgan as the Joker’ mod is pretty self-explanatory, turning the game’s protagonist into the famed DC Comics character, complete with red and white face paint.
You can download the Joker mod from Nexus Mods now. Expect instructions on how to install it to arrive once the game lands. Exactly how creator RedDeadModders accessed RDR2 before release is a mystery, though it’s speculated that Rockstar allowed them, and possibly others, to get their hands on the PC version early.
