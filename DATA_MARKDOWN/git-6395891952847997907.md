BRIDGEPORT, Conn.Â (AP) - Environmental officials are announcing $2.6 million in grants for Long Island Sound conservation efforts.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 20 grants totaling $1.4 million will benefit Connecticut while $250,000 will go to efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont and the remaining funds will be spent in New York.
The money benefits local projects meant to improve water quality and restore habitat around the Long Island Sound watershed.
In Connecticut, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal says the matching funds will help communities install trash skimmers, restore salt marshes, spur growth of fish and bird populations and support environmental education efforts.
The EPA says the projects will treat 8.2 million gallons of stormwater, collect 46,000 pounds of floating trash and prevent 17,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the vital estuary.
