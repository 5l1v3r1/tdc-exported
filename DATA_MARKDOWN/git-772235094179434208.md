Hyundai Australia has recalled the 2019 Venue, Elantra and Ioniq Electric over a problem with the wheel nuts.
According to the company, the affected cars might not have had their wheel nuts tightened correctly. If the nuts aren't tightened correctly, the wheels could come loose and fall off.
The Venue is the worst-hit, with 159 vehicles affected, while there are six Elantra and two Ioniq Electric models included in the campaign. A VIN list is attached here.
Hyundai will contact owners of the affected vehicles and advise them to organise a free fix for the problem. The original recall is attached here.
