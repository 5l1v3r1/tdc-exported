ROME: Napoli's hopes of mounting a Serie A title challenge this season took another blow on Saturday when they lost 2-1 at AS Roma, who missed one penalty and converted another.
The defeat left Napoli with 18 points from 11 games, eight behind leaders Juventus who were away to neighbours Torino later on Saturday.
Nicolo Zaniolo fired Roma ahead in the 19th minute and they missed a chance to go further ahead when Aleksandar Kolarov's penalty was saved by Alex Meret minutes later
Roma were awarded another penalty in the 55th minute, this time converted by Jordan Veretout. Arkadiusz Milik pulled back a goal for Napoli in the 72nd minute but it was not enough to prevent Roma chalking up a third successive league win which left them third with 22 points.
