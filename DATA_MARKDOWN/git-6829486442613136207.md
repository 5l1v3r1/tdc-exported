By now, the unbelievable news has probably sunk in: My Chemical Romance are coming to Australia, somehow.
After all, when the news of the reunion first broke, it wasn’t even clear that My Chemical Romance were going to play more than a handful of American shows, let alone that they would be coming down to Australia.
Sometimes these reunions can be a one and done kind of thing — a flash in the pan that is squeezed in around often confused and hectic schedules. Think of the few Eddy Current Suppression Ring gigs that have been dropped since that band officially broke up.
But nup, looks like the emo legends are really committing to this thing. They’ll be playing two headlining gigs at Download Festival, before moving on to New Zealand with old friends Jimmy Eat World.
And nobody can really deal.
In fact, in the hours since the announcement first dropped, the internet has been a mess of emotional, overwhelmed emo fans trying to process a range of complicated feelings.
