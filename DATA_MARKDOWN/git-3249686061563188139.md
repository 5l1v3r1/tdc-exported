Starship is threatening strong legal action after nude photos of Monsta X Shownu get leaked online.On November 3, an individual on Twitter posted three photos online and claimed that they were of Monsta Xâ€™s Shownu. In the photos, a man can be seen sleeping on a bed in his underwear, and one of the photos is more explicit than the others as he appears to be fully unclothed. The photos in question seem to have been taken in secret while the man was asleep, and they began spreading quickly on social media and online communities.Starship alleged the photos were "fabricated" and released an official statement on the afternoon of the 3rd stating, "We will report to the police those who spread the illegally taken photos for violating the law of Sexual Violence Crimes and will strongly respond with legal action by seeking civil damages against the crime of circulating obscene materials under the Information and Communication Network Act."
