        New Delhi (Sputnik): To combat increasing pollution in Indiaâ€™s national capital, the city government has rolled out a vehicle rationing scheme mandating private cars with license plate numbers ending in odd digits to stay off the roads on even dates and vice-versa.
      
A day after the Delhi government launched the Odd-Even scheme to tackle unprecedented air pollution in the city, netizens took to Twitter to vent their anger over surged pricing by private cab aggregators - something which they, in turn, have denied.
