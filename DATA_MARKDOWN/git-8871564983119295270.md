Film buffs, mark your calendars: Cinema One Originals is screening eight original films in 11 cinemas across Metro Manila from Nov. 7 to 17.
Now in its 15th edition, the festival’s 11-day run showcases movies by indie filmmakers backed by Cinema One, a division of ABS-CBN Films. The festival and its productions are collaborations between up-and-coming film creatives and the network’s mainstays and veteran actors. It’s since churned out favorites like the 2014 rom-com That Thing Called Tadhana (“That Thing Called Fate”) by director Antoinette Jadaone, and the 2016 coming-of-age drama about a closeted teen lesbian Baka Bukas (“Maybe Tomorrow”) by director Samantha Lee.
Solid films, right? Well, here’s what’s in store starting Thursday.
