Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami has had to face the wrath of the news consuming public for his biases in favour of the BJP. However, this week he faced widespread backlash from hardcore supporters of the saffron party and its Hindutva agenda for calling an innocent Delhi man ‘pervert’ four years ago. This prompted Twitterati to slam Goswami while trending #DareArnab on Twitter.
Goswami faced social media roasting for holding a media trial of one Sarvjeet Singh and declaring him a ‘pervert’ after a girl, identified as Jasleen Kaur accused him of molestation. Last week, a Delhi court acquitted Singh of molestation charges, triggering angry reactions from activists and social media users with most being the supporters of the BJP.
