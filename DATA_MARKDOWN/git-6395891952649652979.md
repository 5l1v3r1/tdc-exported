BOSTON - Voters are set to head to the polls in 58 Massachusetts communities on Tuesday, deciding local races that the state's elections overseer said hinge on "some of the most critical issues affecting citizens where they live."
Fewer people typically vote in municipal elections than in statewide and presidential contests, and Secretary of State William Galvin said a turnout rate of 30 percent to 40 percent in any community would be "exceptionally high."
But, Galvin said, it's the local races that determine what a community will be like to live in, with impacts on public safety, education, transportation and the issue Galvin said seems most notable this year -- zoning.
"Zoning and land use development issues seem to be the preeminent issue throughout Massachusetts," he told reporters during an election eve availability. "As I've traveled the state over recent months, it seems when you speak to local officials or candidates running for local offices, almost invariably the first thing they talk about is development. In some cases, it's the lack of housing development, in some cases it's about the nature of the development that's going on and the effect it's having on their existing communities."
Voting hours will vary by community -- polls open at 6 a.m. in Franklin and noon in Lakeville, for example -- and Galvin said voters should check the list on his website to find their city or town's official hours.
