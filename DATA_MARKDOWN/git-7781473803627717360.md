The Maruti Suzuki Ertiga is one of the cars tested by Global NCAP this year and the MPV scored a three-star rating in the sixth round of the 2019 crash test. The head and neck protection for the driver was rated as good. The chest protection for the passenger was good too, however, the driver chest protection was marginal.
The structure of the frame was deemed borderline unstable, which could be a concern as the Ertiga was recently upgraded to the second generation adopting the Heartect platform. The footwell of the Ertiga was termed 'Unstable' as well and the displacement of the pedals showed risk to the driver's legs. The chest protection for the driver and the passenger received marginal protection although the passenger pretensioner failed to work properly.
The Ertiga gets ISOFIX mounts as standard but for child occupant safety, the MPV received poor ratings for an 18-month-old dummy with CRS (Child Restraint System / Child Seat) installed facing forward. CRS mounted rearward is said to be a better practice. It was also brought to notice that the Ertiga does not offer a three-point seat belt for all occupants.
