Mariah Carey has reminded her fans that Christmas is imminent with a fun video showing herself getting ready for the festive season.
The singer, whose hit single All I Want For Christmas Is You is considered one of the best seasonal songs of all time, posted a clip of herself falling asleep on Halloween while dressed in a 1980s-style costume on social media.
The music starâ€™s phone showed the time to be 11.59pm on October 31, before switching over to midnight on November 1.
