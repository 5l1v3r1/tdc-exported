Mothercare has confirmed it is preparing to appoint administrators later today.
The company announced this morning that a notice of intent to appoint administrators to Mothercare UK and Mothercare Business Services has been filed with the court.
The companies will continue to trade and the administration is a “necessary step in the restructuring and refinancing of the group”. 
Mothercare said plans for the future of the group are “well advanced and being finalised for execution imminently”.
