If you grew up with strict parents, you know the struggle of trying to get away with wearing the actually fun Halloween outfit you really want.
And Trisha, a college student from UCLA, is no stranger to this.
For Halloween this year Trisha decided that she wanted to go as a referee, with a bit of a twist. But before setting off for the night and wearing the outfit she had planned, she snapped a photo of the original costume and sent it to her dad.
She then uploaded her real costume, and the one her parents saw onto Twitter, where it went viral.
