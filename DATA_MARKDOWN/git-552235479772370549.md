Skipper Scott Brown is struggling to be fit for Celtic's Betfred Cup semi-final against Hibernian at Hampden Park on Saturday.
The midfielder went off with a thigh injury in the 2-0 home win over St Mirren on Wednesday night and is a doubt.
He declared himself fit afterwards but Celtic boss Neil Lennon revealed earlier on Friday the veteran could now miss the showdown against his former club.
Striker Vakoun Bayo will see a specialist on Monday with regards a knee problem, Leigh Griffiths and Mikey Johnston are back in training while Jozo Simunovic (knee) remains out alongside Daniel Arzani (knee) and Greg Taylor is cup-tied.
Hibs, meanwhile, will assess winger Martin Boyle after he made his comeback off the bench from an ankle break in midweek.
Boss Paul Heckingbottom also reported multiple knocks on unnamed players.
