Trudeau has worn blackface to perform Harry Belafonte’s “The Banana Boat Song Day-O” in high school, for an “Arabian Nights”-themed party as a teacher in 2001, and at least one other time in an undated video. Confronted by journalists, Trudeau said in September that he could not list all the times he had worn blackface because he had done it so often that he did not remember them all.
His Liberal Party nonetheless won a narrow victory in Canada’s October elections, losing 20 seats but keeping enough for Trudeau to remain prime minister.
Trudeau’s office confirmed to Canadian media outlets on Thursday that he would “be trick or treating with the kids, but not going to Rideau Hall [the official residence of the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada] or doing a photo op.”
Canadian broadcaster Global News noted that Trudeau had previously celebrated Halloween in disguises as “as Han Solo, Clark Kent, Sherlock Holmes and the pilot from The Little Prince.”
