Rudy Boesch, a retired Navy SEAL who became a fan favorite on the first season of  "Survivor," has died after a battle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 91.
Boesch died peacefully Friday night in hospice care in Virginia Beach, Va., surrounded by loved ones, said Steve Gonzalez, director of operations for the SEAL Veterans Foundation.
"He was a legend in the SEAL teams long before 'Survivor,'" Gonzalez said. "Rudy was beloved by all and will be deeply missed."
Boesch was part of the debut cast of "Survivor" in 2000, coming in third place. At 72 years old, Boesch was the oldest contestant ever on the CBS show. He proved so popular as a no-nonsense but loveable character that he was invited back for the eighth season, "Survivor: All Stars."
He and fellow contestant Richard Hatch -- who went on to win the inaugural season -- became friends and formed an alliance.

Hatch acknowledged an "interesting bond" with "Dear Rudy" on Saturday.
"You and I helped open minds and undermine prejudices," he tweeted. "While your time here has passed, you will remain loved and iconic, dear friend!"
