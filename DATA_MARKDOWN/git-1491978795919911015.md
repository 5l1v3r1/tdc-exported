Newcastle lie a point above the bottom three before visiting the London Stadium. Steve Bruce’s side are capable of defending well but they have struggled in front of goal and need to provide better service for Joelinton, who has only scored once since his £40m move from Hoffenheim. A more ambitious attacking approach is required if Newcastle are to inconvenience West Ham, who are winless since beating Manchester United on 22 September. Jacob Steinberg
