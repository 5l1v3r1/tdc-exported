We all know the placebo effect is a powerful thing – it can ease pain, alleviate depression, turn CBD into a billion-dollar industry, and more. Less widely understood is why it works – how the human brain, in tandem with various other organs, can turn a simple sugar pill into something that, in some cases and for certain ailments, works just as well as the real, patented, super-expensive, active-ingredient-containing thing. For this Giz Asks, we asked the leading experts on the placebo effect to illuminate this process for us.
