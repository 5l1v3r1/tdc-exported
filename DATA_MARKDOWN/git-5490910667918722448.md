Now that the Barneys New York bankruptcy battle is finally resolved, the question on every fashion-oriented person’s mind is, when is the liquidation sale?
Per the windows at Barneys New York’s Madison Avenue flagship, the liquidation sale has already begun. The windows display two signs reading, “Store Closing Sale” and “Everything Must Be Sold!” both with smaller text underneath reading “Goodbuys, Then Goodbye!”
The retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August, finally found a new owner on Friday in the Authentic Brands Group, buying the historic New York retailer for $271 million. ABG has plans to keep Barneys’ Madison Avenue flagship open for the next year as an experiential pop-up store format, but bring the Barneys name over exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue as its retail partner.
With Friday’s bankruptcy deal, Barneys began its sale, which ABG chairman and chief executive officer Jamie Salter called “transition sales” or “non-store-closing sales” instead of liquidation sales. However, these sales are currently a meager 5 or 10 percent off merchandise across categories — according to the Barneys web site — which, considering the steep prices of its designer offerings, doesn’t account for much savings. Social media has already shown its disappointment.
