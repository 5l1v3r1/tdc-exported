        Nico Hulkenberg leaves the United States Grand Prix with a solid P9 finish and two points, a result the German is happy with. In what could be his final F1 race in the USA, Hulkenberg showed why he has been such a solid competitor during his long F1 career.
      
The Renault man started in 11th and dropped back at the start, but made the most of a good two-stop strategy from his team to regain positions and came back through the field to grab ninth, his sixth points finish in seven races.
Hulkenberg said:Â "I'm really happy to take two points today especially after losing some ground on lap one. It was a race of two, contrasting halves for us. The first part wasn't great, we lost places at Turn 1 and Turn 2 on the opening lap with some cars coming back onto the track in front of me.

        "That made things difficult, but then the second-half of the race was a lot of fun. We converted to a two-stop strategy, maybe a lap or two too late, which was my decision, but we then started catching others in front. We had good pace, some fun fights, so we can be pleased to score two points today."
