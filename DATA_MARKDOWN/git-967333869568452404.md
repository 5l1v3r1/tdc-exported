Speaking at a political rally on Friday night in Mississippi, President Donald Trump specifically expressed regret over the flop of his successful reality TV show shortly after US movie star and former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger took the helm.
“[…] I just did one show, it’s called “the Apprentice”, and it was a big success – 14 seasons - and when I left crazy Arnold took over, it didn’t do too well, it was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him and I said ‘Oh, it’s terrible! What have they done to this beautiful show? Arnold!” Trump said.
The remarks echoed those made by the US President during the National Prayer Breakfast event show in 2017, when he recounted his “tremendous success on The Apprentice” before deciding to leave the show and run for president.
