The creators of This Is Spinal Tap have settled their legal dispute over the film’s soundtrack recordings.
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner formally joined fellow co-creator Harry Shearer in a $400 million (£320 million) fraud lawsuit back in 2017. Shearer, who portrayed Derek Smalls in the film and stars as multiple characters in The Simpsons, filed the original lawsuit in October 2016.
The co-creators have now come to an agreement with Universal Music Group, as Music Week report. As a result, UMG will continue to dispute Spinal Tap’s recordings and the creators will eventually be given the rights to the music.
Shearer said: “I must admit, from the moment we first began mediation with them to now, I’ve been impressed by UMG’s respect for creatives and their distinctive desire to seek a prompt and equitable solution to the issues.”
