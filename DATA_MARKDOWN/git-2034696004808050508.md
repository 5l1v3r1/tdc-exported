Tributes have been paid to Brian Tarantina, after the death of the Marvellous Mrs Maisel star was confirmed.
The 60-year-old, who played the role of Jackie in the Amazon show, was found dead in his New York apartment on Saturday.
A statement from the NYPD confirmed: “On Saturday, November 2, 2019 at approximately 0040 hours, police responded to a 911 call of an unconscious male inside of 353 West 51 Street, apartment 11, within the confines of the Midtown North Precinct.
“Upon arrival, officers observed a 60-year-old male, unconscious and unresponsive, fully-clothed, on his couch. EMS responded to the location and pronounced the aided male deceased at the scene (his residence).”
According to Tarantina’s manager, Laurie Smith, he had been “quite ill” and was recuperating at home.
