        Move over, Google Stadia and Project xCloud – it appears that Valve could be working on a cloud gaming service all of its own.
      
A Tweet from SteamDB revealed that, in a leaked partner site code update, Valve added several lines of code that require Steam partners to sign an addendum to the platform’s terms.
While the code is designed to get partners to fill in a form, the line that’s caught everyone’s eye is “function SignLatestCloudGamingAddendum( returnURL )” as, naturally, it contains the golden words of both “cloud” and “gaming.”
