The United Nations global climate meeting next month will take place in Madrid after previous host Chile cancelled at short notice, officials said.
UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said representatives of the body that organises the annual conference had accepted Spain’s offer to host it in the country’s capital on December 2-13.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera had announced on Wednesday that he was cancelling plans to host the meeting, as well as a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, to focus on restoring security in his country following weeks of protests in which at least a dozen people have died.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s office offered to step in at short notice on Thursday, sending delegates from around the world scrambling to change their travel plans.
