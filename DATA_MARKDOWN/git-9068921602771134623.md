\Apple today seeded the first betas of an upcoming iOS and iPadOS 13.3 update to developers, just a week after the release of iOS 13.2 with new emoji, Siri privacy controls, Deep Fusion, and more. iOS and ‌‌iPadOS‌‌ 13.3 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been installed.
We don't yet know what's new in the iOS 13.3 update, but it likely includes bug fixes for issues not able to be addressed in the prior update. As a 13.x update, it also likely features some feature changes and updates. What's new in iOS 13.3 beta 1: - Communication Limits - There are now Communication Limits in the Screen Time section of Settings for limiting who children are speaking with via the Phone, Messages, and FaceTime apps. - Multitasking Bug Fix - The beta appears to fix the iOS 13.2 issue that was causing apps to refresh more frequently than normal. - Memoji/Animoji Stickers - In the Keyboards section of the Settings app, there's a new option to prevent Animoji and Memoji Stickers from being displayed on the Emoji keyboard. - Apple Watch app - The ‌Apple Watch‌ app icon's Digital Crown is now gray instead of black.
