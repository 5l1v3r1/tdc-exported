Lewis Capaldi has released a reimagined version of “Forever”, available only on Amazon Music.
The track, by the Scots singer, debuts on Acoustic Chill - the new global Amazon Music playlist featuring tracks designed to help listeners relax and unwind.
If you’re not already an Amazon Music Unlimited member, you can listen free for 30 days here .
If you’re already an Amazon Prime member , after the 30 days free trial ends, you’ll pay £7.99 each month, while non-members will have to fork out £9.99.
Our advice - take the 30-day free trial and cancel before the end date - you won’t pay a penny, but will have spent a month listening to original and exclusive content courtesy of Amazon.
 
Amazon Music listeners can simply ask, “Alexa play the Amazon Original by Lewis Capaldi” in the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android and on Alexa-enabled devices.
In addition to the new track, Amazon Music listeners can access hundreds of Amazon Originals featuring both emerging and established artists across numerous genres, available to stream and purchase only on Amazon Music.
