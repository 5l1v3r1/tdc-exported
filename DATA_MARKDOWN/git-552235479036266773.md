Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy following his fallout with fans.
Unai Emery told Xhaka he was no longer part of the Gunners' leadership group as he named Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the new skipper.
The Emirates boss said that the Swiss midfielder "accepted" his decision.
The 27-year-old was left out of his side's squad for their Europa League tie with Vitoria on Thursday.
Xhaka has not played for the club since he told fans to "f*** off" when he was booed following his substitution against Crystal Palace .
He revealed death threats against his wife and messages wishing his daughter got cancer pushed him to "boiling point" and that is why he lashed out at fans.
He said on Instagram: "My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have hurt me deeply."
