Alberta’s cattle and hog producers received a major boost Tuesday from news that China will resume imports of Canadian beef and pork products.
But China is still not accepting shipments of Canadian canola, though many in the agricultural community hope Tuesday’s news is an indication a thaw may be coming on that front, too.
The end of the Chinese ban on Canadian pork and beef, which was imposed by that country in June, was announced on Twitter by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday morning. Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said in a statement later in the day that Canadian authorities will be working closely with beef and pork producers and processors in the coming days and weeks to “ensure successful resumption of trade.”
The announcement comes as China struggles with an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which has decimated the country’s hog herds and increased the demand for imported sources of protein.
