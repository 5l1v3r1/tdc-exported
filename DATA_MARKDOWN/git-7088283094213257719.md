        Some 600 Yellow Vest protest organisers from across France have gathered in Montpellier for a national assembly to debate the future of their movement.
      
The gathering in the southern French city goes on until Sunday andÂ comes ahead of the first anniversary of the protests on 17 November.
"We need to do something that stands out to mark the date," said Fabienne, a delegate from Grenoble who like others attending gave only her first name to reporters.
Jacques, from Lille, said the assembly "shows the extent of the Yellow Vest movement".
Some 200 delegations are due at the assembly. It includes a series of workshops to discuss issues such as how to respond to heavy-handed police tactics or how to work with other protest movements.
