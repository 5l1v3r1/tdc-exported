LAHORE (Dunya News) – Punjab Chief Minister (CM) Sardar Usman Buzdar has on Saturday said that demanding resignation from an elected prime minister is unconstitutional and unlawful.
Usman Buzdar said in a statement that no sane person can support Azadi March. The rejected elements do not want Pakistan to make progress but their negative agenda will fail, he said.
Those who are doing politics on non-issues should be ashamed of themselves, the chief minister added. He said the corrupt leadership will be held accountable for plundering money.
CM Buzdar maintained that this is the most transparent government in Pakistan’s history which is making new records by serving people. The country will definitely prosper under PM Imran Khan’s leadership, he concluded.
