Facebook’s new corporate logo is, in a word, bland, leading to plenty of goofs across the internet making fun of the uninspiring font that appears both boring and sinisterly corporate at the same time. The latest dunk comes from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who posted a tweet mocking the uninspiring design.
Dorsey’s tweet appears to be referencing two oddities of the logo: the “rebranding” of Facebook to an all-caps “FACEBOOK,” and the way Facebook will be using the new text-only logo. Per the announcement, Facebook (the parent company) will be adding the new logo to the various services it owns, like WhatsApp and Instagram, in the form of a “From FACEBOOK” tag at the bottom of various pages to constantly remind users that the corporate monolith owns them.
