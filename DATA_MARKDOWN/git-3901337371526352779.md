He is one of the quickest players in the PSL, so it comes as no surprise that Thapelo Morena, opted for a car that is as quick as he is. Check out the Bafana Bafana star’s ride before joining Mamelodi Sundowns.
Morena’s rise in the local game has been nothing short of remarkable. Pitso Mosimane transformed the pacey winger into a right back after he joined from Bloemfontein Celtic.
Since making the switch, the 26-year-old has managed to pin down the right back berth for both club and country as his own.

Off the field, the Randfontein-born man is a doting father, who has a penchant for fast cars.
Before joining Downs from Celtic, Morena revealed a stunning Golf IV GTI on his Instagram account, which he referred to as “his baby”

It is possible that he has since upgraded his ride at the star-studded Downs parking lot.

        Do you think Morena is the best right back in Mzansi?
