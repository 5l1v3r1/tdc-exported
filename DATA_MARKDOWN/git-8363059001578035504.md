After some good, old-fashioned rooting around, it seems that Google disabled the Pixel 4's DisplayPort Alt Mode over USB in the kernel source code.
XDA-Developers editor-in-chief, Mishaal Rahman, shared the discovery on Twitter, pointing out that there doesn't seem to be a reason as to why this is the case. The Qualcomm chips offer native support for DisplayPort Alt Mode, while Rahman adds that it's not even as if licensing fees could be the culprit.
