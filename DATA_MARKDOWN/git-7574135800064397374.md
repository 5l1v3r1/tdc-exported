Brooklyn’s Sondra Sun-Odeon released her debut album Ætherea all the way back in 2012, and now she’s finally set to follow it with her sophomore album this month, almost exactly seven years to the day Ætherea was released. The new LP is called Desyre, and like Ætherea, it features some very cool collaborators. This time Sondra worked with Thor Harris (Swans, Shearwater, etc), J.R. Bohannon, Lia Simone Braswell (A Place to Bury Strangers), and Mary Lattimore, and it was recorded, engineered and co-produced by frequent Zola Jesus collaborator Alex DeGroot.
We’re premiering the title track and its video, which was co-directed by Sondra and James Autery, and stars Sondra alongside Dia Dynasty, Arone Dyer, Lisa Garfield, VEMiLO, andGuya. Sondra says:
While Ætherea was on the dark psych-folk side, Desyre is a harder-hitting album, thanks in part to Thor Harris on the drums, and the title track is a very good example of the new sound. It’s brooding, doomy goth rock, and if you’re into stuff like Chelsea Wolfe or that Marissa Nadler/Stephen Brodsky album, you probably wanna give this a spin too.
The album comes out November 22 via Graveface (pre-order). Check out the new song/video below.
