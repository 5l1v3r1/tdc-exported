Cape Town - Henrik Stenson says he has no security concerns ahead of the Hong Kong Open that is scheduled to be played later this month.
The tournament looks set to be played despite ongoing civil unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.
Stenson, who will be part of a strong field that will include former Masters champion Patrick Reed, said he had no concerns about the current unrest in the Asian city.
The Swedish golfer said: "I've never had any real concerns travelling anywhere in the world to play golf.
"We have a Tour and they always put the safety of players and fans first.
"It's something that I leave for the European Tour as part of the staging of this event, and whenever thereâ€™s the go-ahead to play a golf tournament I'm there ready to play.
"It's never been a concern of mine."
A number sporting events that have been due to take place in Hong Kong have already been called off
The Hong Kong Open tennis event, which is part of the WTA Tour and was due to be held in October, was cancelled while the Hong Kong Open squash championships also halted.
