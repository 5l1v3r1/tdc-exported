President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles following the Springboks' successful victory in the Rugby World Cup final.
And this was never more evident in a touching moment between the president and Springbok captain Siya Kolisi moments after South Africa emerged victorious on Saturday, captured by ITV.
Shortly after winning the match, Kolisi can be seen getting the president's attention from the podium with a victory sign and a fist pump, to which Ramaphosa returns the love with a wave and a smile from ear-to-ear.
