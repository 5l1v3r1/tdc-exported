On Wednesday, reports emerged that Wolves winger Adama Traore had finally made a decision on his international future, pledging his allegiance to Mali, his parents' homeland.
According to the maliactu.net, Traore has elected to represent the African nation over his country of birth and could feature during the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later this month.

The 23-year-old, who was previously courted by Mali back in 2014 but chose not to switch allegiance at that stage, represented Spain in age-group level football as recently as 2018.
Traore was born Spain and graduated from the Barcelona's famous La Masia academy before moving on to Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and now Wolves, where he has caught the eye after a string of impressive performances.
