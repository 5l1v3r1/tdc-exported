The video’s 40 minutes long, it’s called ‘Pastry Chef Attempts to Make Gourmet Sour Patch Kids‘ and it does exactly what it says on the tin.
Claire Saffitz, the host, has the affable air of a Sunday school teacher. When she gets irritated, which is early in the video, it’s a kind of Playschool angry — angriness without any of the rough edges. She’s always smiling, even as she’s dejectedly throwing a plate of mutant orange jelly into the bin.
Her voice, gentle and keening, makes it sound like she’s reciting koans.
But, crucially, she’s not a martyr, or a preacher. Saffitz might be calm and quiet, but she’s also self-depreciating. She has seen the true face of things, and is acutely aware that they suck. When she complains, her eyes twinkle a little.
As in: ‘both of us know that things are bad and will always be bad, but acknowledging that the world is that way makes it better, hey?’
