Thulani Hlatshwayo, Ricardo Goss and Gift Motupa all form an integral part of the Bidvest Wits side, besides forming the nucleus of Gavin Hunt’s team, the trio have similar taste when it comes to their cars. Check it out. 
Hlatshwayo, who captains both Bafana and Wits, took to Instagram to display the Clever Boys’ VW gang.
