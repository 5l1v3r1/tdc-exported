        Leader visits forest school in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s seat in bid to regain west of England as stronghold
      
The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has insisted that her party can again make the west of England a stronghold even in places that voted to leave the EU.
In a show of confidence, Swinson’s bus rolled into North East Somerset – Jacob Rees-Mogg’s constituency – on Thursday for a visit to a forest school nursery.
Swinson lit fires, whittled a hazel stick, toasted marshmallows and argued that the excellent results in the local election results in May that put the Lib Dems in charge of places like Banes (Bath and North East Somerset) could be repeated in the general election.
