Gidley pointed out flawed ABC News reporting that rushed to judgment on conservatives despite not having the evidence.
“For ABC to make the comment that it wasn’t up to our standards to put on television, I guess that doesn’t apply to Kavanaugh, I guess that doesn’t apply to Covington kids, I guess that doesn’t apply when you put up a video that and say ‘look at the shelling in Syria’ but it’s actually Kentucky,” Gidley said in an interview with Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart Editor in Chief Alex Marlow.
