In order to keep its social network free of malicious bots, Facebook keeps trying out new tactics.In its latest test, it’s deploying facial recognition tech to spot fake profiles.
The feature, spotted by app researcher Jane Manchun Wong, asks you to take a video selfie and turn your head from side to side in order to verify that you’re not a bot.
The text in app screenshots posted by Wong reads, “We need a short video of you turning your head in different directions. This helps us confirm your identity and check you’re a real person.”
