OTTAWA: China has agreed to resume imports of Canadian beef and pork, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday (Nov 5), signalling a breakthrough in their tense relations.
"Good news for Canadian farmers today: Canadian pork and beef exports to China will resume," Trudeau said in a tweet.
He lauded Canada's new ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, who was appointed in September, and the country's meat industry for working to reopen "this important market for our meat producers and their families."
