Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to lay out his plan for Brexit after the British Prime Minister said voters deserve to have a “clear picture” of what potential leaders will do about it.
General Election campaigning appeared to ramp up between the two leaders ahead of the dissolution of Parliament at a minute past midnight on Wednesday.
Mr Johnson, who will chair a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, challenged the Labour leader to “come clean” about his plan for leaving the European Union, ahead of a speech from Mr Corbyn in which he is expected to set out his intentions.
In his speech in Harlow, Mr Corbyn will also accuse Tory leader Mr Johnson of trying to “hijack” Brexit so he can sell out the NHS if he is returned to power in the General Election on December 12.
