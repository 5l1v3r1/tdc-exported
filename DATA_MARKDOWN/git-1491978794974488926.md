A man has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving after a crash in which a person died and 15 others where injured in south-east London.
The man, the driver of a car involved in a collision with two single decker buses, is currently in police custody.
Police were called to Sevenoaks Road in Orpington at just after 10.10pm on Thursday following reports of a collision.
Officers from London Fire Brigade (LFB) and London Ambulance Service (LAS) attended. Paramedics treated 15 casualties but did not offer further details on the extent of their injuries.
An LAS spokesman said it had “dispatched a number of resources to the scene”, including 10 ambulance crews. “We treated 15 patients and took them to hospital.
“Despite the best efforts of our medics, a person sadly died at the scene.”
The LFB assistant commissioner Graham Ellis said: “Firefighters rescued several casualties from the buses and immediately undertook first aid.”
