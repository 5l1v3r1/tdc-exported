Lewis Hamilton finished eighth in the opening practice session for the US Grand Prix.
Hamilton, who is set to wrap up his sixth world championship this weekend, used much of the running to trial next year’s tyres.
But, in the closing moments, the Mercedes driver posted a lap good enough to finish inside the top 10.
Max Verstappen set the early pace in Austin, ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and Alex Albon in the sister Red Bull.
