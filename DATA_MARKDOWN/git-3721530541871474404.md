Regice is the most useful of the Regis in Pokémon Go, but that isn’t saying much. It’s still a necessary part for those participating in the Colossal Discovery event, as well as those who are just trying to complete their Pokédex.
Regice is weak against fire-, rock-, fighting- and steel-type moves, so there are quite a few counters you can use against this thing. Check out some of the following below:
This pretty much uses the same counters as Registeel, but just take some fire- and fighting-types and it’ll be over quick. Stay away from flying-, grass-, ground-, and dragon-types for this fight.
Lucky players may encounter a Shiny Regice. Do note that if you do see a Shiny, it will catch on the first ball you hit it with, so use a Pinap Berry to score some extra candy.
Once you nab your Regice, give it Frost Breath and Blizzard for it make the most of its ice-typing, but do note that Regice is not that great of an attacker.
Regirock will leave raids with its siblings on Nov. 4 at 4 p.m. ET.
