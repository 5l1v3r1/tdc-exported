A video which is available on the "tiny animals" account on Twitter shows a little white dog sitting on a sofa in front of an inflatable toy notebook. It looks attentively at her owner's hands showing how to type and then repeats the typing movements with such vigour that it makes the owner and somebody else behind the camera burst into laughter.
