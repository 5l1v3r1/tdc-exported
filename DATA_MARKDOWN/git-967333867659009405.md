        New Delhi (Sputnik): India's women’s cricket team may have been beaten by a single run during the first of a three-match One Day International (ODI) series against West Indies, but the team put up a great show with T-20 format captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s sensational catch.
      
Indian woman cricket team’s all-rounder Harmanpreet Kaur clean bowled everyone with her astonishing single-handed mid-air catch during the ODI against West Indies women in the Caribbean island nation of Antigua.
The slow-motion video of the Indian star, who got into a bird-like stance for a split-second to catch out West Indies skipper Stafanie Taylor, has taken social media by storm. 
While it looked like the ball that had raced for six from Taylor’s bat would sail over boundary rope, scoring a hundred for the Caribbean skipper, Kaur appeared from nowhere and leapt into the air to catch the ball with her left hand.
