With the release of the 2nd-generation of Ryzen processors last year, AMD introduced its brand new 2XXXG range. Seemingly a throwback to the older APU style of processors (processors that contained a graphics adaptor solution) the range proved to be highly popular for those looking for a basic gaming system on a budget. In fact, we were so impressed with them that we even did a build based on one of them that you can check out in the video below!
Following on from their confirmed release of the Ryzen 3950X and 3rd-generation Threadripper processors today, however, AMD has thrown in an unexpected, but none-the-less pleasant surprise. A new AMD Athlon APU style processor is on the way!
