In what is probably the most boomer move in history, a 60-year-old man has said that the word “boomer” is the same as “the n-word”.
Yep. Bob Lonsberry, a radio host from New York, feels so personally attacked by the surge of “ok boomer” that he believes the word is as offensive as a racial slur.
In a tweet he later deleted, Bob said: “‘Boomer’ is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new.” Lol. Ok boomer.
His argument makes little sense because as a 60-year-old, a person born in 1959, Bob is a literal baby boomer. The dictionary defines a baby boomer as “a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the US between 1946 and 1965.”
Armed with this information and on a mission to school a boomer, Dictionary.com shut Bob down. Hard.
