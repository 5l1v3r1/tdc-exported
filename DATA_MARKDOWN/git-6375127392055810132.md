Northern Police District (NPD) Director Brig. Gen.

The suspect was caught by surprise when operatives accosted him and immediately took his caliber, 38 revolver with two live ammunition after he failed to produce its license and permit to carry firearms outside the residence.
When frisked, the suspect yielded two big heat-sealed plastic sachets containing shabu weighing 100.46 grams with an estimated street value of  P684,000 and P500 cash.
