        After getting another penalty for a last-lap lunge, Toro Rosso driver Daniil Kvyat didn't hold back, as the Russian called the five-second penalty which dropped him out of the points "bulls***".
      
Kvyat crossed the line in P10 and looked to have bagged a point, but a post-race investigation ended in a five-second time penalty for the 25-year-old, dropping him down to P12. 
His move on Sergio Perez in the final lap was deemed illegal, much like his move in the last lap of last weekend's Grand Prix in Mexico, when he sent it down Nico Hulkenberg's inside, resulting in contact and a penalty as well.
