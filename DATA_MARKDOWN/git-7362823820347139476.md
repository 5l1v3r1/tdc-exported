The president also touted his apparent ability to mobilize voters before Election Day, citing Tuesdayâ€™s too-close-to-call gubernatorial race in Kentucky, as well as promising to host a rally in Louisiana to garner last-minute support for Republican candidate Eddie Rispone, who is running against Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards.
