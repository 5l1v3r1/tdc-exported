“I’m on the road a lot, and it’s not always easy [to stay fit and healthy], but look, I feel so much better [when I work out], and it helps make sure that this body keeps working, for a long time, I hope,” 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) explained to Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow in an exclusive interview Thursday morning.
Breitbart News Daily airs Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern, on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125.
