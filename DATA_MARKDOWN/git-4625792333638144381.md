MSNBC's Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski spent only four seconds on their show to mention President Trump was leaving New York to avoid the steep taxes.
Brzezinski mentioned the move in a brief of morning headlines but failed to mention where and why the president was leaving New York.
Trump announced Thursday that he was moving his permanent residency from New York to Florida to avoid paying more in taxes.
