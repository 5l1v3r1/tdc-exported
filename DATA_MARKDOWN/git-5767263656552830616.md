You will probably agree with the idea that photos from previous centuries have some charm about them. Yes, in the past, photos were almost like treasures and people really prepared for them: they chose their clothes, did their hair, thought about the perfect positions, and as a result, created a small masterpiece. But it is not just that: the people in these portraits have a special look.
The Bright Side team is convinced that the bright and expressive faces in these old photos are seen less often now. And in order to prove our point, we have prepared a collection of portraits that has both the celebrities of that time and regular people — someone’s great-grandmothers and great-grandfathers.
Do you know anything about your great-great-grandmothers and great-great-grandfathers? Do you have photos of them?
