Police suspended their regular afternoon press briefing today over six reporters who had donned helmets bearing slogans calling for an end to police violence.
The reporters from RTHK, Ming Pao, Stand News, Initium, AM730, and InMedia were each wearing protective helmets with a Chinese character stuck to them. Put together, the characters read, “Investigate police brutality, stop police’s lies.”
As soon as officers sat down for the briefing on the weekend’s protests and arrests, Senior Superintendent Ko Chun-pong from the Police Public Relations Bureau asked the reporters to remove their helmets.
When the reporters refused to comply, the officers left the room, and PPRB personnel tried to get the six reporters to leave.
