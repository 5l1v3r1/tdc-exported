        Will we find out what happened to Dr Ruja? *Contains spoilers!*
      
It’s Friday October 25 and I’m in London due to meet the journalists behind The Missing Cryptoqueen, but they’re not here. And neither is the latest instalment of their eight-part podcast series.
Instead, they’re in Frankfurt, Germany, following a lead that could alter the whole direction of their real-life, ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Dr Ruja Ignatova – the individual at the centre of their investigating, and the alleged perpetrator of a multi-billion pound cryptocurrency scam. That fresh twist had delayed the latest episode (pushed back from Thursday to today, Monday October 28) as the show races to a thrilling conclusion next week (Monday 4 November). 
“We took a gamble on this trip now,” says producer and co-writer Georgia Catt down an international telephone line, as she dashes between airport gates along with host Jamie Bartlett. “We took a gamble on on coming here, and it hasn’t not paid dividends.”
