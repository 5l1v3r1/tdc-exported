Police have erected a cordon outside an empty restaurant opposite a Nando's in Staffordshire.
The empty restaurant has been cordoned off by officers after cops swooped amid reports of an attack on a man.
The male was attacked overnight in Staffs, reports StokeonTrentLive , our sister title in the region.
Officers were called to the scene at Etruria Mills, Hanley, at 4.50am this morning following reports of an assault overnight.
The victim, aged 38, has been taken to hospital following the incident, but his condition is not known at this stage.
The restaurant unit has lain empty since 2017 after Bella Italia pulled out of joining Nando's, Costa and TGI Fridays at the Etruria Mills development.
A Staffordshire Police spokeswoman confirmed no-one has yet been arrested in connection with the assault.
She said: "Police were called at 4.50am to Etruria Mills, Hanley, following reports of an assault overnight.
 
"Officers are in attendance at the location, but no-one has been arrested in connection with the incident at this stage.
"The victim, a 38-year-old man, has been taken to hospital."
