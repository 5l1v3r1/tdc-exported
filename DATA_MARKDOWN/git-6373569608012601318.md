A woman charged with assaulting police officers, being in possession of a pair of scissors and a razor blade has failed to appear at court via video link from prison due to illness.
Emma Bowhay, of Stuart Road, Stoke, was initially detained under the Mental Health Act last Thursday night following an incident at the top floor of the Regent Street car park behind Charles Cross police station.
She was taken to Derriford Hospital for treatment before being assessed and released into police custody.
Following interview the 35-year-old was charged with breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order, possession of a pointed article in a public place - namely a pair of scissors, assault on an emergency worker, obstructing a police constable in the execution of their duty and possession of a bladed article - namely a razor blade.
She appeared at Plymouth Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning where she was formerly charged. She offered no pleas at that time and was remanded into custody with the intention of her appearing via video link on November 1,
However, she failed to appear on that day due to illness and her case was adjourned until today, but again she was deemed by the prison nurse to be unfit to appear via video link.
The case has been adjourned again to be heard on November 8, by video link.
