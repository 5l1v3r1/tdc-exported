MDC president Nelson ChamisaÂ will this week present a Hope of The Nation Address to deliver hope for a nation experiencing a myriad of crises last experienced in 2008.
Speaking in a video he recorded and uploaded on Facebook, Chamisa said that the Address will deal with a number of issues. He said:
Zimbabwe is currently experiencing severe food shortages, with millions in need of aid. Major hospitals are functioning below par as doctors fail to go to work due to meagre salaries.
Moreover, inflation is estimated to be over 500 per cent, major cities do not have adequate running water and there is rampant corruption and looting of state resources.
