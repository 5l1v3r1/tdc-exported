Tess Daly has said working with Terry Wogan on Children In Need was an “utter privilege”.
Wogan hosted the annual telethon for 35 years, latterly alongside the Strictly Come Dancing presenter.
Daly said working with the veteran broadcaster was the highlight of her time on the charity broadcast.
Children In Need returns to the BBC this month, with Daly at the helm for a night of fundraising and special shows.
The presenter revealed that she has to watch appeal videos in advance to avoid being shocked and left in tears live on TV.
She said of her work on the annual broadcast: “The highlight of my Children In Need years will always be getting to stand by the great man, Sir Terry Wogan’s side.
“What a pleasure and utter privilege that was.”
Wogan died in 2016 after enjoying decades as the face of Children In Need, and other BBC work on Radio 2 and presenting the UK’s Eurovision Song Contest coverage.
Daly has her own packed schedule in the countdown to Christmas, with Strictly in full swing.
