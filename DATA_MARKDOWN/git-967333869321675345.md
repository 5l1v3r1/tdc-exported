        House Democrats are continuing the impeachment process after adopting guidelines last week to increase transparency. All new witness testimony to the House committees will now be released to the public in written form.
      
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has adopted an unconventional line of defence for the US president over the latter's alleged abuse of power. According to the Senator, the Trump administration could not form any quid pro quo relations with Ukrainian counterparts, because they have been shown to be incapable of inculcating a coherent policy towards the east European state.
Graham attempted toÂ scold the House Democrats' impeachment of Trump, calling it "political vendetta" and questioning the legitimacy of the process currently spearheaded by the chairman of House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
