Big budget Netflix drama The Crown is returning to TV screens with Olivia Colman as the British Queen.
But for many reviewers it is the supporting cast who elicit most praise in the lavish series.
Here is what the reviewers say about the third season, which begins in 1964.
Carol Midgley in The Times awards the drama four stars, calling it a “class act, luxurious and gorgeous to watch — if slightly more ‘soap opera’ than the last.”
