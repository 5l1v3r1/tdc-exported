The Washington Nationals are celebrating their 2019 World Series win with a Saturday afternoon parade through Washington, D.C.
The Nationals triumphed 6-2 over the Houston Astros on Wednesday during Game 7 of the World Series.
The team was invited to visit the White House on Monday, though pitcher Sean Doolittle said he "can't do it" because of President Trump's policies and rhetoric.
