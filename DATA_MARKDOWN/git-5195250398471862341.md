The idea of dual-purpose adventure tourers is just catching on with the Indian motorcycling enthusiasts as more new models are being explored and some are already there in the market for people to buy like the Royal Enfield Himalayan and Hero XPulse 200. KTM’s 390 platform has two motorcycles, the Duke and RC, pertaining to different set of customers.
When the BMW G310GS arrived at a rather premium price tag, the expectancy on an Adv based on the 390 platform only skyrocketed as the Duke 390 and RC 390 are already known for their performance, packed features and aggressive styling at a luring price range. After seemingly years of testing, KTM has finally lifted the covers off the 390 Adventure.
KTM’s EICMA stage is dominated by several high-end motorcycles including the flagship naked, the 1290 Super Duke R, but the 390 Adventure is certainly grabbing the eyeballs for all the right reasons. It takes power from the same 373 cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder, fuel-injected powertrain used on the Duke 390.
