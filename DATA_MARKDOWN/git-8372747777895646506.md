In addition to a number of restaurants offering free meals on Monday, Nov. 11, a number of businesses are offering their services to veterans and active duty as a thank you for their service.
Check out our list below of different offers. Offers are good for Monday only unless noted. Offers are at participating locations only, and most offers require proof of military service.
Goodyear Auto Service: Goodyear is offering free car care checks and free tire installation to all active and retired members of the U.S. military, which it says is a $25 value. Veterans and active duty can book appointments from Nov. 8 to 11, and the offer can be redeemed by Nov. 16.
Great Clips: Active duty and veterans can receive a free haircut on Monday. If you're not ready for a haircut, Great Clips will give you a voucher on Monday for a free haircut that can be redeemed by the end of the year.
Planet Fitness: Veterans and active duty are invited to workout for free from Nov. 8-15, and stay for a free HydroMassage and chair massage. Planet Fitness is also allowing vets and active duty to bring a friend for free.
