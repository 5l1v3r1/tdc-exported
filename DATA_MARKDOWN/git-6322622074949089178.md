KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): RHB Retail Research said i-Stone Group Bhd may move higher after it continued holding above the 22.5 sen support.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said with the 21-day SMA line edging upwards, this implies a positive outlook sentiment.
“A positive bias may emerge above the 24 sen level, with an exit set below the 22.5 sen threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the 26.5 sen mark. This is followed by the 27.5 sen level,” it said.
