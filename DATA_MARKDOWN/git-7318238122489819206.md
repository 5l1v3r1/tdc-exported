Storms pounded Italy over the weekend, causing flash floods and evacuations in the country's northwest.
Video released by the Italian fire brigade on Sunday (November 3) showed a resident being placed on a stretcher and lifted down from a balcony with ropes after a mudslide hit their home.
Schools across the Liguria region were closed on Monday (November 4) as the weather alert continued, with forecasts of heavy rain and strong winds.
