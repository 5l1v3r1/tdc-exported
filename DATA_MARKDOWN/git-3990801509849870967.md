If you have ever visited China, you know not every outlet accepts cards. Some of them will only accept mobile payment methods such as AliPay or WeChat pay. Till now, these apps didn’t allow foreigners to link their credit or debit cards to the app to make mobile payments.
However, Alibaba and WeChat said yesterday travelers will be able to link their international cards to their payment apps now.
To use Alipay in China, you’ll have to download the app and indicate you want to install the international version while signing up. The payment service will support Visa, MasterCard, Japan’s JCB, and Singapore’s Diners Club cards.
