South Africa stormed to a 32-12 World Cup final victory over England in Yokohama to claim their third title.
Here, the PA news agency looks at the reaction from social media.
Former England flanker James Haskell said on Instagram: “Congratulations South Africa. Great performance and thoroughly deserved. Obviously I am devastated for England, every player and staff member could not have done more. They should all be proud of what they have achieved. I am proud of every one of them. I hope fans and the media remain level headed.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson also extended congratulations to the victorious Springboks and agreed that England can reflect on the tournament with pride.
