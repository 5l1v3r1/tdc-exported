        Protesters plan more action after violent night that saw attack on state-owned Xinhua agency
      
China’s state-owned news agency, Xinhua, has denounced the attack on its Hong Kong office by pro-democracy protesters as “barbaric”.
In a brief statement late on Saturday, Xinhua strongly condemned the “barbaric acts of mobs” that had vandalised and set fire to the lobby of its Asia-Pacific office building in the city’s Wan Chai neighbourhood.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association also deplored “any act of sabotage against the media” and called for an end to violence against the press.
It was the first strike against the official Chinese news agency in a show of anger against Beijing, which many in the city fear is infringing on the freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.
More protests were planned across seven districts on Sunday in a sustained push for political reform and genuine autonomy, after China’s ruling Communist Party vowed to tighten its grip on one of the world’s freest financial hubs.
