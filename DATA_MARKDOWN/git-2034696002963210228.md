        Tired of hearing about the President? Netflix can help
      
Netflix is introducing a button so you can skip all the Donald Trump jokes in the new Seth Meyers comedy special.
New show Lobby Baby, which launches today (November 5) sees the comedian take aim at the President, who he has repeatedly criticised in the past.
Speaking to CNN Business, Meyers said that it was his idea to introduce a button that allows you to skip mentions of Trump in the show.
The comedian calls it “a funny and innovative way” to “take advantage of the Netflix experience”.
