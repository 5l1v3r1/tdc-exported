South Sudan's president Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar agreed on Thursday to extend by 100 days a deadline to form a power-sharing government, a regional official said, after they failed to resolve outstanding disagreements.
Kiir and Machar "agreed to extend the pre-transitional period for one hundred days, effective from 12th of November, 2019, and to review progress after fifty days from that date," Uganda's Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa said, following a rare meeting between the rivals in Uganda attended by high-ranking regional representatives.
