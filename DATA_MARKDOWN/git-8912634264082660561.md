DUBAI: Egyptian actor Haitham Ahmed Zaki, son of the late acting legend Ahmed Zaki, died at the age of 35 in Cairo on Thursday.
Police reports said Haitham’s fiancee tried to call him several times without response, according to local media. He was later found dead.

Haitham started his acting career in 2006 when he debuted in the movie “Halim,” a biopic about the Egyptian singer Abdel Halim Hafez.
Production started in 2005 with his father Ahmed co-starring as the lead actor, but Haitham later filled in for Ahmed after he passed away on March 27, 2005, prior to the film’s completion.
