ATTLEBORO, Mass.Â (AP) - A Massachusetts man has been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for molesting a 5-year-old girl he knew.
The Sun Chronicle reports that 55-year-old James Hickman was sentenced Thursday in Fall River Superior Court following his conviction earlier this week on charges of indecent assault and battery on a person under 14 and committing unnatural acts on a child under 16.
Prosecutors say he molested the girl in her Attleboro home in June 2016. He was arrested in Georgia in 2017 based on DNA evidence.
Hickman's lawyer, Ted Koban, argued for a two-year prison term. His client had denied any wrongdoing.
Authorities say Hickman faced similar charges in 2003 involving a 9-year-old girl, but the case was eventually dropped by prosecutors because she was not able to testify.
