Aston Villa have finally got on the right side of a video assistant replay (VAR) decision.
Trezeguet's 21st minute goal threatened to be disallowed by technology , but it was allowed to stand much to the relief of the Villa Park faithful.
Villa have seen goals chalked off at Crystal Palace and Brighton and Hove Albion this season while it denied them a blatant penalty at Arsenal in September.
But this time the goal was permitted to be given by Jon Moss, who checked with VAR official Martin Atkinson to ensure Trezeguet's volleyed effort stood amid worries that an offside call would be given against the Egyptian international.
 
And Villa fans have had their say on social media about the incident.

        Here's the pick of the reaction..
      
@ mrkhannaa : VAR - taking the soul away from football
@ AndrewBrought14 : At last we get the decision but that wait is awful VAR ruining the atmosphere
