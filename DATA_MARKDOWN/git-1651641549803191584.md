Apple’s iPhones suffered from a bug last week which caused apps to get kicked out of RAM quickly than normal. Despite the increased ram and performance, users were quickly finding that their apps wouldn’t stay in memory once they navigated away from them — no matter how briefly. Tabs in Safari would vanish like wisps in the wind, flled in messages would clear, and YouTube videos would reset back to the beginning.
The new iOS 13.2.2 update has been rolled out to address this issue, fixing this along with a few others.
Here’s the changelog:
The update is rolling out to iPhones and iPads running iPadOS today. While not being a massively huge update, it showcases the flexibility Apple has in rolling out updates to fix user-facing problems in (checks watch) just over a week since it debuted.
