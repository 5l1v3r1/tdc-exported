Scammers are spoofing phone numbers from federal agencies to defraud Canadians, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.
The centre, which itself has had its number spoofed, said the calls appear to come from a legitimate phone number or police detachment.
The scammers have targeted the Courts Administration Service, the Canadian Revenue Agency, the Department of Justice Canada and more.
Anyone who receives a scam call is asked to report it to the anti-fraud centre by going to www.antifraudcentre.ca.
The centre is reminding people to not hand over personal or financial information to callers.
