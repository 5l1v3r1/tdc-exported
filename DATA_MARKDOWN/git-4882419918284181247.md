Barcelona trained on Sunday morning at the Ciudad Deportiva Joan Gamper de Sant Joan Despi with minds on the Champions League clash against Slavia Prague on Tuesday.
Coach Ernesto Valverde took charge of a recovery session after the 3-1 defeat in which the first team squad were joined by Barca B's Carles Perez, and Juvenil A's Ansu Fati and Tenas.
Luis Suarez started his own recovery work after his calf injury on the trip to Valencia.
The team are set to train again next at 7pm on Monday after a press conference around 4pm from Ernesto Valverde and Nelson Semedo.
