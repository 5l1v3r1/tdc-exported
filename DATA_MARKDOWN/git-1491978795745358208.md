        Donald and Melania Trump have filed for residency in Palm Beach, according to documents obtained by the New York Times
      
The lifelong New Yorker has officially become a Florida man. Donald Trump has changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago – the exclusive golf club that he has referred to as the “winter White House”.
“I cherish New York,” Trump said in a tweet on Thursday. But, he said, “despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.”
