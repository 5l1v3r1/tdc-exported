Ariana Grande fully leaned into her Twilight Zone Halloween costume, based off the 1960s series' "Eye of the Beholder" episode, and had a Halloween party themed off the show last night. Some incredible company celebrated with her: Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, and Blackpink's Jennie were among the celebs there.
Ariana has collaborated with Lizzo (they just released a remix of "Good as Hell") and Nicki Minaj. Ariana hinted in July that she'd love to collaborate with k-pop group Blackpink, and the girls attended her Coachella show earlier this year.
Ariana's brother Frankie shared a shot of him and Ariana together, Ariana channeling The Twilight Zone again and Frankie as the Ambassador of Mars from Mars Attacks!.
Nicki, meanwhile, shared a shot of her and Ariana from the party's photo booth with Justine Peacock and film producer Thembi Banks. Of course there was a photo booth with a personalized party logo; practically every big celeb party has one. Kendall Jenner's Halloween party that same night had one too.
Lizzo was at Ari's fest as a DNA test, and she had a moment checking Ariana's famed pet pig Piggy Smallz's breath. Apparently it smells like syrup, so the pig is thriving:
