BOISE, Idaho (AP) - The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says 10 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related illnesses.
Boise television station KTVB reports health officials say no single substance has been associated with the cases.
The illnesses are marked by respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.
Nationwide roughly 33 people have died and nearly 1,900 people have been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those numbers to rise because of a lag in reporting.
