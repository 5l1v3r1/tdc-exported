Kris Jenner got emotional while remembering her friend Nicole Brown Simpson more than 25 years after her murder.
Jenner was joined by family friend Faye Resnick in a sneak peek for the upcoming episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” The duo grabs lunch at Los Angeles restaurant called Toscana, where they shared many meals with Nicole before her death in 1994.

“I don’t know how long since you’ve been here, but the last time I was here was with you and Nicole,” Resnick says in the clip.
“We sat right over there, and I can tell you exactly what she ordered,” Jenner quickly responds. “She ordered the white fish with the spinach and the roasted potatoes, and I think she had a margarita.”
The waiter then comes over and reveals that the restaurant is celebrating its 30th anniversary by offering its original menu items — the very same that the trio of women would have dined on all those years ago.
“Wow, that’s … that just gave me chills,” Jenner tells her friend. “I have goosebumps everywhere.”
