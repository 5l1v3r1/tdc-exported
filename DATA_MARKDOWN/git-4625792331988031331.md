David Axelrod warned that Pete Buttigieg's public opining about the 2020 Democratic primary is "unhelpful" to the South Bend, Indiana, mayor and a "campaign strategist's nightmare."
"The campaign strategist’s nightmare: When the candidate goes all pundit in an interview. Unhelpful," tweeted the chief strategist for President Barack Obama's campaigns on Saturday. Linking to a Newsweek article, Axelrod added the mayor's punditry was "Honest but unnecessary. All part of learning the rules of a game in which candor can sound like hubris."
