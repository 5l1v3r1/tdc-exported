BERHAMAPUR: Odisha weightlifter K Ravi Kumar, who has been banned for four years by the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) for violation of anti-doping rules, on Tuesday said the investigation has not been completed and he is confident of coming out clean.
Kumar further added that he has already presented his case before NADA and would present all the necessary documents soon.
"NADA has only completed its protocol. The hearing is underway and I have presented my case before the agency. I am very confident of coming out clean. I will not let my career get ruined," said Kumar, who won gold in the 69-kg category in the Commonwealth Games held in New Delhi in 2010 and represented India in the 2012 Olympics.
The 31-year-old, however, ruled out the possibility of taking part in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
In June this year, NADA had provisionally suspended Kumar for violation of anti-doping rules after he failed a dope test.
"Earlier, NADA had suspended me provisionally from June. Now it has completed its protocol and set the period for which I will be banned," said Kumar.
