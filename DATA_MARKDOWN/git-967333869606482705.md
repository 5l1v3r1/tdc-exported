        The incident occurred after Royal Netherlands Air Force firefighters forgot to switch back to shooting water for the F-35's arrival ceremony following their response to an actual emergency involving an F-16 Viper fighter.
      
During a ceremony to mark the arrival of the Netherlands’ first operational F-35A Joint Strike Fighter on Friday, the warplane was accidentally covered in firefighting foam rather than water cannon.
A video showed two crash trucks at the Royal Netherlands Air Force starting to shoot a “water” arc to salute the F-35 which is seen rolling across the tarmac and then shortly coming for a stop.
