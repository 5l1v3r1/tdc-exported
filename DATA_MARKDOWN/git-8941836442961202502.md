PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A judge is expected to rule on a challenge to Rhode Island’s ban on the sale of flavored vaping products.
Superior Court Judge Brian Stern is slated to rule Tuesday afternoon on a temporary restraining order sought by the Vapor Technology Association and the owner of RI e-Cig and Vapes.
The order would bar enforcement of the September ban.
The Washington-based industry group argues that only state lawmakers have authority to ban flavored vaping products. It also says the ban will hurt more than 400 local businesses licensed to sell e-cigarettes.
Gov. Gina Raimondo says she signed the executive order to protect children.
State health officials said last month that two residents have been treated for confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related lung illness.
