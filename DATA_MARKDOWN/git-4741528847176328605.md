A Nigerian-based IT expert, Ridwan Lawal, got a shocker when he applied for the position of a Project Manager in the United Kingdom (UK) but got a response from the company, ENGIE, offering him a cleaning job instead.
Lawal had applied for the Project Manager role at ENGIE, and within 24hours, he got an offer from the company, informing him of the cleaning job. ENGIE seemed to have ignored his initial application, and this didn’t sit well with Lawal, who shared the mail he received from the company on Twitter.
It is a multinational electric utility company which operates in the fields of energy transition, electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear, renewable energy and petroleum. The company is headquartered in France.
