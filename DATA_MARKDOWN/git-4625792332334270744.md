Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka was banned on YouTube for failing to adhere to copyright laws when he played music from the band Imagine Dragons without their permission.
The ardent Trump ally, 49, repeatedly played Imagine Dragons songs on his radio show, "America First," but the band's lead singer Dan Reynolds asked him to stop. When he refused, YouTube deleted his channel Monday. A platform spokesperson told the Daily Beast that his channel "was terminated due to multiple copyright strikes."
