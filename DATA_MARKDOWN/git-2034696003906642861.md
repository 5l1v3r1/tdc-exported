        Were the original caterers closed on Sunday?
      
Kanye West‘s Sunday Service has come under fire after images of an extremely paltry-looking brunch, reportedly selling for $55 a plate, were posted on social media.
According to reports in The Daily Mail, the brunch consisted of a Styrofoam plate of lukewarm pancakes, bacon, sausage, and grits; while Kanye’s Friday night (November 1) performance at Baton Rouge, Louisiana was not charged, many fans felt the extortionate meal price was unacceptable given its poor quality. Attendees posted various photos of the disappointing meal on Instagram and Twitter with the hashtag ‘#Brunchella’, and several people likened the food served to that of the notorious Fyre Fest debacle in 2017.
