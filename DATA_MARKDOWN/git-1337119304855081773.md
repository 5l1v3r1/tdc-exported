Twitch is losing another major streamer: Jack “CouRage” Dunlop — one of the most popular Fortnite streamers on the site with over 2 million followers — has announced he’ll now exclusively stream on YouTube Live. Dunlop’s first YouTube stream will start tomorrow on November 5th.
As has become the tradition with big streaming platform changes, Dunlop announced the move in an elaborate video featuring fellow 100 Thieves members Matt “Nadeshot” Haag and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter that also makes it clear that Dunlop will still be saying with the e-sports organization.
