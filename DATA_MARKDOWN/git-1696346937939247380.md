        Chinese mining giant Bitmain is in the midst of a power struggle. Co-founder Micree Zhan who was ousted last week has returned with a vengeance asserting that he will use a legal team to regain control of the company.
      
Last week’s news that Jihan Wu had taken control of the world’s largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier was music to the ears of Bitcoin Cash holders. Wu is a big proponent of BCH and the company reportedly hoarded a huge stash of it in 2017. He told employees not to engage his former partner as the spat intensified.
The ousted Micree Zhan who owns an estimated 36 percent stake in the company has not taken the move lying down. According to an open letter published on WeChat and sent to all Bitmain employees, Zhan described the move as a coup without consent.
