LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- An Estero High School employee could be fired Tuesday after getting arrested for armed robbery.
Shantell Thomas was arrested back in August, and has been in jail since then.
In public documents, the school board says she admitted to committing robberies, car burglaries, and stealing cars for about two months.
She has been suspended without pay since early September.
There will be a special session to determine her fate.
