In hurling, Ballygunner did what they do best while the big shock of the day came in Leinster.

        Athletic Grounds
        
        Crossmaglen (Armagh) 0-9 Clontibret (Monaghan) 0-10
      
Three times these sides have met in the Ulster club championship with each of those games coming down to a single point. The only difference this time being that Clontibret were on the right side of the result.
Led by Crossmaglenâ€™s own John McEntee, the Monaghan outfit were on the front foot from the get-go in Armagh leading by 0-7 to 0-3 at half-time thanks to two booming efforts from Farney star Conor McManus.
