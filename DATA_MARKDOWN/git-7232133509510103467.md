An executive at Facebook has said that Libra will not spread in the same way that the company’s social network did. Kevin Weil believes that the social media giant’s foray into the crypto asset space will take decades to fully roll out.
Weil is also not perturbed by the intense regulatory scrutiny into the planned digital currency. He claims that Libra will be worth the hassle in the long run.
According to a report in CNBC, Kevin Weil, the vice president of product at Facebook’s digital wallet unit Calibra, gave his thoughts about the planned “crypto” during the Web Summit technology conference held at the Altice Arena and Lisbon Exhibition & Congress Centre in Lisbon, Portugal, this week.
