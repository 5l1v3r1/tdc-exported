        Xbox’s latest Elite controller, the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, is now officially up for purchase in most countries.
      
While the controller sports a price tag of $179.99/£159.99, it’s worth it for what you get. With adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair trigger locks, wrap-around rubberised grip, and re-engineered components, this controller is made for those who want to get the absolute best out of their games.
The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 also offers intimate customisation options thanks to its interchangeable thumbsticks and paddles and its range of button remapping options.
With six adjustable thumbsticks (two standard, two classic, one tall, and one wide dome) and four modifiable paddles (two medium, two mini), you can adjust your controller exactly to your liking and have full control over the way you play.
