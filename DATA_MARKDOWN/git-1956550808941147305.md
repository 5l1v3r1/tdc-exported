One of Abu Dhabi’s most impressive hotels is about to celebrate a milestone.Qasr Al Sarab Desert Resort by Anantara is celebrating its tenth birthday with some new experiences for guests.Head down to the desert retreat, through he stunning dunes along the way, and you can try something a little bit different to your standard staycation (it was voted the most-insatgrammable hotel in the world earlier this year, after all).To celebrate, the resort has launched the Bedouin Night Camping Experience. You can choose to arrive at the outdoor camping site by camel ride or by hitching a ride in a 4x4. Once at the site, a majlis will welcome you where you can enjoy some dates and Arabic coffee before checking into your camp room overlooking the dunes.While you’re there you can also have an authentic Emirati meal, watch falconry shows and try activities including archery and dune bashing.We don’t know about you but a night under the stars away from the busy city is sounding pretty good right about now.Prices vary.
