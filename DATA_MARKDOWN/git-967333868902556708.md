The president's wife, Melania Trump, appeared embarrassed after her husband gave Suzuki an "awkward hug" at the White House after the Washington Nationals won their first World Series.
The Washington Nationals baseball team won the World Series after a heated game Game 7 against the Houston Astros ended with a score of 6-2, becoming the the first Washington team to win the title since 1924.
Suzuki put a MAGA (for Make America Great Again) cap on his head when invited to speak. At that moment, Trump hugged him from behind while Suzuki was raising both of his hands to the crowd, as Trump mouthed: "I love him".
