If you've been left intrigued by Ring Fit Adventure but haven't yet taken the plunge, you'll be pleased to know that you can now check it all out for free at a number of locations around the UK.
Nintendo's taking its fitness and RPG mash-up on tour, giving players a chance to get their sweat on and see what the game's all about. It's all kicking off this month; the London event took place over the weekend, and more locations and dates can be found below.
In your one hour session, you can expect to experience the game either solo or with three other people of all ages and fitness levels. Places are limited but free; you can go ahead and book your session here. You'll also be able to enter a competition to win a Nintendo Switch console, Ring Fit Adventure and a Â£100 voucher from the Nintendo UK Official Store by attending. Full details on that can be found here.
