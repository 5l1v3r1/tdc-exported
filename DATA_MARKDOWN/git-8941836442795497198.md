Washington Nationals pitcher and World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg issued his first tweet in 18 months to call out “fake news” after a now-viral video appeared to show him snubbing President Trump’s handshake during his team White House visit on Monday.
Mr. Strasburg retweeted a 10-second clip that showed him concluding his speech at the White House and then seemingly ignoring Mr. Trump’s extended hand.
The clip, posted by Twitter user Rudy Gersten, titled, “Strasburg left Trump hanging,” has racked up more than 2 million views.
“#FakeNews,” Mr. Strasburg wrote above the retweeted video.
