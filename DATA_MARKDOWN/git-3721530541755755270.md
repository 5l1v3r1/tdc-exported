The Black Friday festivities begin this year with Kohl’s releasing its ad, including sales which are bound to save you a few bucks on your new purchases. But, before we dive into the deals, we should probably talk a bit about Kohl's Cash, which forms the backbone of this retailer’s Black Friday bargains.
Basically, for every $50 you spend at Kohl's, you get $15 in Kohl’s Cash — so long as the purchase falls between Nov. 25 and 29. Kohl’s Cash earned within this period must be spent between Nov. 30 and Dec 9.
It’s a good option to pursue if you regularly shop at Kohl's, and would have use down the line for the virtual currency. The ad also features a 15% off coupon, which can be applied to some purchases made between Nov. 25 and Nov. 29.
You can drop in for Black Friday starting on Thursday, Nov. 28 at 5 p.m. EST.
