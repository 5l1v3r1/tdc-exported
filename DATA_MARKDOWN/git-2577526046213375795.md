“F” in a moment of internet tragedy, when a YouTuber confesses they were mercilessly dumped. In a flash of live, online embarrassment, when an Overwatch player misclicks on ult, “F.” The internet is a graveyard of “FFFFFFFF,” with some uncountable number tossed off every hour, everywhere, to pay respects.
Five years ago today, the Call of Duty team unintentionally gave a new life to the letter “F” with one of the most flippant, most iconic gamer scenes in all of media. It was the first scene of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, released November 4, 2014. Let’s remember the moment that brought us the meme.
A sombre funeral is underway for a soldier who died in South Korea—the best friend of protagonist Private Jack Mitchell. It is a serious and sad scene. Delicate violin music swells as soldiers take turns touching the casket. Then, it’s the player’s turn. Looking over at your fallen comrade’s picture and into the graveyard’s distance, a prompt appears on-screen: “Press F to Pay Respects.” Above it, it reads, “Pay Respects F.” You hit the button and touch the coffin.
