Yesterday, Nintendo reconfirmed multiple upcoming releases on Nintendo Switch. Highly anticipated ones like Animal Crossing: New Horizons obviously won't be showing up until next year and Metroid Prime 4 doesn't even have a date.
Luckily, there are plenty of other first-party games ready to go this holiday season. The major ones in particular – as can be seen in the slide above – include Ring Fit Adventure, Luigi's Mansion 3 and Pokémon Sword and Shield.
Company president Shuntaro Furukawa also notes how there are plenty of other third-party options, to satisfy the "diverse needs" of consumers.
