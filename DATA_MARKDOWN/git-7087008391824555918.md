Ethereum marked a small increase of around 1% over the past 24 hours and it currently trades at $190. This allows ETH to grind its way higher toward the $200 level, and perhaps even more. However, it still needs to break above resistance at the 100-days EMA. 
Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency as it holds a market cap of $20.74 billion.
