Harry Kane is out of Tottenham's clash at Everton through illness.
In a huge blow for Spurs, their talismanic striker will miss the game with Lucas Moura set to step in up front.
The England captain has started the season in good form, despite his side's tribulations in the first months of the campaign.
He has 10 goals in 13 matches in all competitions and has already found the net on six occasions in the Premier League.
Spurs go into the game at Goodison Park 13th in the Premier League but could jump up to eighth with three points.
The Toffees are in even greater strife, sitting just one place above the relegation zone and with boss Marco Silva under huge pressure.
Gareth Southgate is set to be at Goodison with Dele Alli among those looking to catch the eye of the England boss.
On criticism of Alli so far this term, Mauricio Pochettino said: "We need to remember that Dele is still so young and the demand and the pressure on him is massive.
“Everyone expects big things from him but he’s only 23 years old. OK, he’s now dropped a little bit but we need to help and back him.”
Youngster Ryan Sessegnon is part of Spurs' squad for the first time since signing from Fulham in the summer after overcoming a hamstring injury.
