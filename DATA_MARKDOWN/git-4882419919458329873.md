Ernesto Valverde says he is not thinking of resigning from Barcelona after the team went down 3-1 at Levante on Saturday.
"I'm not thinking of resigning," said the coach, when asked if he would quit. With a serious face, he reiterated his commitment to the club.
The question had been asked after a third defeat in La Liga, away from Camp Nou, after falling against Levante and Athletic, which allows league leaders Barcelona to be overtaken by Sevilla or Real Madrid.
"We have to analyse what happened and ask ourselves why it did," said Valverde in his press conference.
