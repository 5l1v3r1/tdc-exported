The signals are strengthening as the winds of economic change blow harder. A global economic slowdown has already begun as central banks scramble to prop up their economies by printing more money. The last financial crisis was caused by banks and it is highly likely theyâ€™ll be responsible for the next one.
Just over a decade ago the world was plunged into the largest financial crisis since the 1920s. The US banking system single-handedly collapsed the world economy by over lending to cover derivatives trading. It took years to recover but it seems like the economic skies are darkening again.
Last week the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the third time this year. The move is largely to encourage spending and borrowing while discouraging saving. For President Trump, however, this is not enough as he wants negative interest rates.
In another typical Trump tirade the POTUS blasted the FED again late last week stating that the central bank is a bigger economic threat than China, which is having its own banking problems.
