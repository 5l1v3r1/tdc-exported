Katie Holmes has revealed she sometimes works out with her 13-year-old daughter Suri.
The former Dawson’s Creek star, 40, said the pair exercise together when their routines overlap.
She told Shape magazine: “Sometimes I work out with my daughter.
“It just depends on the day. We have our routines, and occasionally they overlap.
“But I don’t force her to work out with me because I know that’s lame.”
Holmes also talked about the bond she has with Suri, whose father is her ex-husband Tom Cruise.
“I feel very blessed to have such a special daughter,” she said.
“Being her mum is absolutely the greatest gift and privilege.”
