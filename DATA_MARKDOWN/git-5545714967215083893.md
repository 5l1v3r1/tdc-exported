Headcannon, the co-developer behind the excellent Sonic Mania, has begun crowdfunding on Kickstarter for its next project, a ghoulish 16-bit-style title called Vertebreaker.Vertebreaker is a classic side-scrolling platformer similar to the many that swamped the Sega Mega Drive and Commodore Amiga in the early '90s. It concerns the adventures of skeletal hero, Richard Boehner, who has returned from the afterlife to gain redemption against the malevolent force that put him six-feet-under, the mighty King Calavera. Now just a bony shell of his former self, Richard must run, jump and swing his way through a selection of multi-tiered stages, bopping baddies and collecting bones. Using his trusty grappling hook - crafted from a demon's spine - Richard can climb, swing, pull and even slingshot himself around the environment, upping his speed and traversing the landscape.
