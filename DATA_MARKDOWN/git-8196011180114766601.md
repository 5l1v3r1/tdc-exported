Stephen Larkham earned himself a deserved reputation as one of the most stylish rugby players of his generation when representing Australia on 102 occasions.
So it came as quite a surprise yesterday when Larkham, nowadays the senior coach at Munster Rugby having figured in a similar role with the Brumbies back home, declared the “skill levels over here are probably better than in Australia”.
While acknowledging the massive differences that prevail between the two countries, especially where weather is concerned, he insisted he very much likes what he has seen since his arrival in Ireland last summer.
““But I’ve been really impressed with the players in the first five rounds of the PRO14,” he said. “I think the talent, the skill level over here is probably better than in Australia. It is said that Irish skills aren’t what they should be.
Larkham had good friends to advise him about making the massive decision to uproot his family and leave the many home comforts of sunny Canberra behind to take up his role as senior coach at a club many thousands of miles away.
And he also underlines that the name of Munster in a rugby context meant an awful lot to him.
