DUBAI: At least four women are raped every hour in India and only one out of those four cases is actually reported. According to Times of India, rape is also the fourth highest offence committed against Indian women.
And yet, Bollywood – one of the biggest film industries around the world and easily India’s biggest cultural export, continues to be okay with trivialising a matter as sensitive as rape.
Bollywood newbie, Kartik Aaryan’s upcoming film, Pati Patni Aur Woh’s trailer was recently unveiled. The film also stars Bhumi Pednekar and star kid, Ananya Panday. A remake of 1978 classic of the same name, Mudassir Aziz’s film has irked many with one of the dialogues in the three-minute trailer.
