CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Browns have cut safety Jermaine Whitehead following a meltdown on social media on Sunday in which he threatened a radio host and Browns fans following the team’s loss to the Broncos.
Whitehead struggled during the Browns 24-19 loss to Denver, missing multiple tackles throughout the game, one of which led to a Broncos touchdown.
A few moments after the team left the field, Whitehead allegedly began responding to tweets about his play on his account, @j2whitehead_.
Some of the responses contained explicit language and racial slurs.<
Whitehead reportedly attacked Dustin Fox, a Cleveland sports talk host, as well as fans. Screencaps reportedly show that Whitehead threatened to kill a fan.
Twitter suspended the account within 30 minutes of the first threatening tweet.
Following the game, Whitehead declined to speak to reporters, according to Tom Reed of The Athletic.
