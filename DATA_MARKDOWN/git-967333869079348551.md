        New Delhi (Sputnik): As Indian pilgrims prepare to pay obeisance at the holy Kartarpur Gurudwara on the occasion of 550th birth anniversary of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak, a viral video of alleged Pakistani national flags being hoisted atop houses on the Indian side of Punjab appears to be aggravating tensions between the two arch-rival countries.
      
A video of banners hoisted on the terrace of several buildings in Jalandhar, a city in India’s northern state of Punjab, was shared on Twitter with a caption reading that Pakistan's national flags had been raised in an Indian town.
The video was shared by Pakistani Twitter user Mohammad Alikhan, who hailed Prime Minister Imran Khan for his Kartarur diplomacy, captioning it as: “Sikhs Fly Pakistani Flags In Jalandhar India On Top Of Their Houses. Pakistan Zindabad. This is @ImranKhanPTI’s KartarPur Diplomacy.”.
