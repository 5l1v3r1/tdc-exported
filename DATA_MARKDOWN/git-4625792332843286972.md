DES MOINES, Iowa —⁠ Pete Buttigieg is back-peddling his prediction the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination contest will come down to a battle between himself and Elizabeth Warren.
"I don’t remember the exact context," the South Bend, Indiana mayor told reporters in Iowa on Saturday evening, adding he didn't think his remarks "came out right.”
Buttigieg's earlier critique of the Democratic field had seemed to inflate his own chances against Warren, a Massachusetts senator, ignoring rivals like former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
"Look, the bottom line is this is a really strong competition among really strong campaigns," Buttigieg, 37, said Saturday.
