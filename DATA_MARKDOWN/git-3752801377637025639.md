Tears, cheers and what can only be described as exhilaration spread through the capital city on Saturday as the Springboks lifted the Web Ellis trophy. 
South Africa dominated England in 2019 Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama, beating them 32-12. 
Tries by wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe closed the game out and sent Pretorians into overdrive. 
Thousands of residents in the capital city gathered at different venues to view the game. One venue, next to Loftus Versveld Stadium, home of the Blue Bulls, was packed to the rafters.
