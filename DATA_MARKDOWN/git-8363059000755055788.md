The Halloween season has officially ended, but it takes time to fully process the number of good costumes out there. Celebrities, especially, have it particularly good when it comes to Halloween and often get amazing costumes as a result. After all, not all of us can afford to have a costume made for us and photographed by professionals. I’m lucky to make it to Halloween Express every year.
That doesn’t mean the costumes celebrities come up with are any less enchanting, though, and I have to admit I am extremely taken with one in particular. Cardi B’s Poison Ivy is here, it’s calling to us all, and it’s incredible.
