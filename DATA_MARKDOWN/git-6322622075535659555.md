BEIJING (Nov 6): Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe discussed Hong Kong, Taiwan, the South China Sea and Xinjiang with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday during a telephone call, state media said.
Wei “stressed” China’s position on those issues, and called for cooperation and stability between China and the United States and their militaries, the Global Times newspaper said.
