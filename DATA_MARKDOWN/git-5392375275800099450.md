Today, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 which was released in March 2018 got a new stable update (MIUI V11 0.2.0 stable version). Although this update is MIUI 11, it is still based on the Android 9 Pie system. Amongst other features, this smartphone will now support face unlock application, photo-text watermark editing, Xiaoai voice wake-up feature, gaming features such as a phone docking window, etc.
This update is currently rolling out to Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 units in China. However, it shouldnâ€™t take long for the global counterparts of this device to get the update. As usual, all units will not receive the OTA update at the same time, thus you may want to check settings > system update for available updates.
