        What a collaboration
      
Eddie Vedder and Red Hot Chili Peppers teamed up over the weekend to deliver their own take on Prince‘s ‘Purple Rain’ and Jimi Hendrix’s ‘All Along The Watchtower’.
The performance came during the encore of an annual fundraising concert for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music – the non profit music school founded by RHCP bassist Flea almost twenty years ago.
While the Chilis also performed hits like ‘Soul to Squeeze’, ‘Suck My Kiss’ and ‘By the Way,’ Vedder performed a solo set of assorted Pearl Jam favorites.
