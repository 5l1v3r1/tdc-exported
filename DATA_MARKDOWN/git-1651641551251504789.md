Microsoft has released a new Skype Insider Preview Build 8.54.76.86 with a couple of important new features.
The new Skype Build now lets you send audio messages from your desktop just like you send voice messages through Skype on your smartphone. The new update also added the Translated Conversation feature, taking advantage of which you can easily chat with your friends in a different language.
Aside from that, the update comes with plenty of bug fixes and performance improvement. You can see the official changelog below.
These new features are being rolled out in a phased manner, meaning that it’s very much possible that you won’t get the update today. If you haven’t received the update yet, the best you can do is wait for a few more days.
