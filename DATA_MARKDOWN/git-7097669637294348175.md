Gordon Ramsey is one of the biggest celebrity chef's in existence and is a household name spoken in living rooms across the world. Sure, the British chef is known for his no-filter lashings toward contestants on Hell's Kitchen and for his five-star restaurants found in major cities, but he is also a well-known car guy with quite the collection.
For a day full of fun with family and friends, Ramsey heads to the Brands Hatch racetrack with a dozen of his cars in tow. Apparently these are just his U.K.-based cars, meaning that he likely has an even larger collection of cars elsewhere. Among the worthy is a McLaren Senna, Porsche 918 Spyder, and a Ferrari La Ferrari Aperta. Ramsey seems to be blown away by the fact of seeing all his cars from the United Kingdom on track together for the first time.
