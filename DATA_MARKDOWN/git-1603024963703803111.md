Maharashtra may head for President's rule if the new government is not in place by November 7 in the state, Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said on Friday.
The minister's comments came as there appeared no headway in government formation even eight days after results of the October 21 Assembly elections.
Talking to a Marathi TV channel, he attributed the delay in talks between BJP and Sena to Diwali festival, adding parleys will start in a day or two.

If the Sena decides, it can get the required numbers to form a stable government in Maharashtra, he said.
Raut said that there are no talks yet between BJP, Shiv Sena on government formation.Special Thursday Expiry on 10th 7th NovEarly Closure to The Great Diwali Discount. Last Chance to get Moneycontrol PRO for a year @ Rs. 289/- only Coupon code: DIWALI
