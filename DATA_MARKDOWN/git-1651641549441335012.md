Microsoft To Do for Windows 10 has received an update. Taking the app version to 2. 4. 23042. 0., the update brings a noteworthy new feature alongside bug fixes and performance improvements.
With the latest update installed, you’ll be able to print lists of tasks in the Microsoft To Do app. Beyond tasks, it’ll also print sub-activities, date as well as emoji. You can find the option for print by right-clicking on the name of the lists that you want to print. Alternatively, you can also click on the three-dot view(…) located at the top right corner of the app to print the list of tasks.
The update is currently limited to Windows Insiders, meaning that if you’re using regular Windows 10, you are not eligible for the update. Nevertheless, Microsoft is eventually going to bring it to all Windows 10 users once the feature gets ready for the public rollout.
You can download Microsoft To Do app on Windows 10 PC from the below link, or you can head over to Microsoft Store.
