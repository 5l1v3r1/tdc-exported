The collision calculator, part of the Omni Calculator Project, was built by Álvaro Diez, a physics student at the University of Warsaw in Poland, who had built it in about a week and the majority of that time was spent making the tool appealing and understandable to a broad audience.
Diez has built other calculators as well, such as an Exoplanet discovery calculator and a black hole temperature calculator — all to share knowledge with fellow researchers and other people online.
He added that he was motivated to construct the collision calculator by the recent run of big black-hole news. Earlier this year, for example, scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope project released the first-ever direct image of a black hole's shadow. 
And just last month, one team of astronomers announced the detection of a star being ripped to shreds by a black hole, and another team discovered three supermassive black holes that are on a collision course.
