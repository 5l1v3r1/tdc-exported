InWin is something of a mildly curious brand in that everyone who knows PC components will have heard of them, but they’re not necessarily one of the first names that would roll off the tongue either. That is, perhaps, partly to do with the fact that they’re not a brand widely associated with inexpensive products.
With the release of the brand new 925 Premium PC Chassis, however, who knows? Perhaps this will be the new home of your next system build! Well, presuming you have a pretty healthy bank balance!
The InWin 925 is, essentially, a slightly smaller version of their prior 928 Super Tower design. The main perk, however, is that despite it being slighter lesser in scale, no compromises have been made to the overall style and performance of the chassis.
In terms of PC cases, this is definitely geared towards the HEDT/workstation of consumers.
