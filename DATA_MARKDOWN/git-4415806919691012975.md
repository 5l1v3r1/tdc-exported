Sinn Féin has announced it will not stand in three constituencies in Northern Ireland to help other pro-Remain candidates defeat DUP Brexiteers.
The party is standing aside in south and east Belfast and North Down – a move that puts the republicans in the highly unusual position of explicitly urging supporters to vote for a unionist, in the form of incumbent North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon.
Announcing the move in Belfast, party president Mary Lou McDonald also urged voters to back the SDLP’s Claire Hanna in South Belfast and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long in East Belfast.
