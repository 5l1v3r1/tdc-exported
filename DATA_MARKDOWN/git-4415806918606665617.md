Paddy McGuinness has told of his anger after a stranger questioned why he had parked in a blue badge space when he and his children “don’t look disabled”.
The TV star, whose six-year-old twins Leo and Penelope have autism, said he was dropping his children off at a play centre when the man approached.
Posting on Twitter, he said while he wanted to “bounce him off every car”, he instead took a deep breath.
McGuinness said: “Just had a deep breathe and walk away moment.
“Dropped my little ones off at a play centre.
“Parked in a disability space while they got out. Had all our relevant disability badges on display only for some bell end to come over and tell us that we don’t look disabled? #ignorance.
