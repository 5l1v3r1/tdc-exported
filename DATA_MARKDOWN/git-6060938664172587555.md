LUCKNOW: Height became a problem in finding accommodation for an Afghani man who flew down to watch the one-day international cricket series between Afghanistan and West Indies here.
Sher Khan, who is 8-feet-two-inches tall, visited several hotels in search of a place to stay but no hotel allegedly agreed to rent him a room due to his height.
Disappointed and alone in a new city, Khan approached police for help and the cops took him to Hotel Rajdhani in Naka area where he spent Tuesday night.
Hundreds of people gathered outside the hotel to see the tall man, who is a resident of Kabul. "As many as 200 people have come to see him. He is very disturbed," hotel owner Ranu said on Wednesday.
Due to the people gathered outside the hotel, the police had to escort Khan to Ekana Stadium where the first ODI was played on Wednesday.
The hotel owner said the man will be staying in the city for the next four to five days.
