DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco’s chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan said on Sunday the state oil giant would continue to meet its global oil supply demand after it lists on the Riyadh bourse.
Rumayyan was speaking after Aramco kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) earlier on Sunday, officially announcing its intention to list on the domestic bourse, Tadawul. [nL8N27J02H]
Rumayyan also said the local listing was a reflection of a strong global position.
“Listing Aramco on Tadawul proves its strong position among global markets,” he told a news conference.
