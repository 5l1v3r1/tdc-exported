SCHOOL children are discovering how learning a language can boost their brain power in a `pop-up museum'.
The Pop-Up World of Languages also allows pupils to understand different accents and their reactions to them.
The free museum, at the Accidental Theatre in Belfast, included interactive activities for children, teenagers and adults.
The activities draw on the research from a large project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council called Multilingualism. Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies, involving Queen's University Belfast and three other institutions.
Pupils can take part in a journey through three zones to uncover the hidden treasures of languages through family-friendly, hands-on activities and games.
They include the `languages and me' zone in which young people will learn more about the many languages they already know without even realising, and where speaking them can take them in life.
The `languages in the world' zone will introduce visitors to the languages that are most spoken and those that are in danger.
"If you are already interested in languages, there is still plenty to learn about how languages work, how they can boost your brain power and where they can take you," said Professor Janice Carruthers from Queen's.
