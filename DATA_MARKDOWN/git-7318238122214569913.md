LONDON — Donald Trump lobbed a grenade into the heart of British politics Thursday night, something that's become a habit for the president, as he called into a radio show hosted by one of his friends on the populist right.In his call with leading Brexit supporter Nigel Farage on LBC radio, Trump praised Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a "fantastic guy" and said opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn would take the country "into such bad places."But because Trump is reviled by so many in the U.K., his intervention might have the opposite effect to the president's stated intention. Just 19 percent of Brits have a positive opinion of Trump, according to the pollster YouGov, and more than two thirds say they have no confidence in the president to do the right thing, a study by the Pew Research Center found last year.Britain just kicked off a divisive and unpredictable campaign ahead of a rare December election. The contest ultimately seeks to answer how the country should leave the European Union, or whether it wants to at all.
Trailing in the polls, the opposition Labour Party immediately turned the president's negative remarks into a campaign line.It was a chance for Corbyn, a left-wing firebrand, to promote himself as Trump's ideological opposite, while casting Johnson as the bedfellow of a president widely disliked in the U.K."Donald Trump is trying to interfere in Britain's election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected," Corbyn tweeted within minutes of the interview being aired.
