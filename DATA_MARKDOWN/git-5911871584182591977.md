A Kacey Musgraves Christmas special is coming. Today, the country musician announced The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show, which will debut on Amazon Prime Video on 11/29. The special will feature appearances from Lana Del Rey, Kendall Jenner, Camila Cabello, Zooey Deschanel, Fred Armisen, Leon Bridges, Troye Sivan, James Corden and the Radio City Rockettes. Musgraves will do “I’ll Be Home For Christmas” with Del Rey, “Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree” with Cabello, and a brand-new Christmas song called “Glittery” with Troye Sivan. Schitt’s Creek’s Dan Levy narrates the whole thing.
Musgraves is no stranger to Christmas music: She put out A Very Kacey Christmas a few years ago, which included some holiday originals that are actually pretty good! (“Ribbons And Bows” in particular goes off.) A lot of the songs featured in the Christmas special are also on that album.
“I can say without a doubt that this project is unlike anything I’ve ever done before,” Musgraves said in a statement (via Billboard), continuing:
The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show will also have an official soundtrack that’ll be out on 11/29, as well. Check out the tracklist for that and a teaser for the show below.
