SAN DIEGO (AP) - Police searched for a gunman who shot three employees - killing one - at a fast food restaurant in San Diego on Wednesday.
The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. at a Church’s Chicken in the Otay Mesa area, officials said.
The suspected gunman had been in the restaurant earlier, when he tried to pay with a counterfeit $100 bill, San Diego Police Officer John Buttle told KNSD-TV .
He came back minutes later and opened fire on employees behind the counter, Buttle said.
One victim died at a hospital. Two others were hospitalized in unknown condition.
The gunman was described by witnesses as a thin man in his 30s, wearing a light blue sweater, red sunglasses and a San Diego Chargers beanie. He was possibly driving a dark blue sedan, police said.
