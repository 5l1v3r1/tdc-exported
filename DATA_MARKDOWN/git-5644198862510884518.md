WASHINGTON: The US official whose whistleblower complaint led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump offered to communicate directly with Republicans on the intelligence committee leading the inquiry, his lawyers said on Sunday (Nov 3).
The action was in response to Republican efforts, led by Trump, to unmask the whistleblower, a member of the US intelligence community whose identity has not been released, lawyer Mark Zaid said. Republicans have "sought to expose our client's identity which could jeopardise their safety, as well as that of their family," Zaid wrote on Twitter.
News of the offer came as Trump called on the whistleblower to come forward, in a stark departure from norms in such cases.
"The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward," Trump said in a morning Twitter post.
