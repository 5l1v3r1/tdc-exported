Navjot Singh Sidhu, cricketer-turned politician, warned the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday that if the authorities do not respond to his third letter, he will “proceed to Pakistan as millions of Sikh devotees go on eligible visa”.
According to India Today, the former minister had repeatedly sent reminders but MEA has failed to revert back or to cater his request to attend the Kartarpur Corridor inauguration which is scheduled on November’9.
The former cricket star’s third letter comes two days before the inaugural ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor.
