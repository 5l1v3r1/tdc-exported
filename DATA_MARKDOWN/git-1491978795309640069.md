        Swedish teenager needs help getting back to Europe following the COP25 meeting’s move from Chile to Spain
      
As delegates to the COP25 climate summit scramble to adjust to a last-minute change of venue from Santiago to Madrid, one of the highest-profile attendees has stuck out a metaphorical thumb on social media to ask for a lift across the Atlantic.
Teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was speaking in California during a stop on her low-emissions journey from Sweden to Chile, tweeted that she was now in need of a ride to Spain.
Thunberg, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved, had been travelling by boat, train and electric car when the new venue was announced.
“It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way:)...If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,” she tweeted from Los Angeles.
