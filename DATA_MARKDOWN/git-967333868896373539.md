        The day before, El Salvador gave Venezuela's diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, explaining the decision by the country's vote in the Organisation of American States (OAS), which supports a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemning alleged violations of the human rights of Venezuelans.
      
Venezuela expelled on Saturday diplomats of El Salvador, giving the officials 48 hours to leave the country.
