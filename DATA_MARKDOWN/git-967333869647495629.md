        MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The United Kingdom’s Cabinet Office has blocked the publication of a forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which was reportedly due to show a drop in public finances, citing its general election guidance.
      
The student loans reportedly added 12.4 billion pounds ($16 billion) to the borrowing figures.
According to The Guardian, the decision to block the forecast came two days after Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill scrapped the impact assessment of the Labour Party’s election pledges, referring to the same guidance and triggering a backlash from some of the Conservatives. The UK is set to hold a snap general election on 12 December.
