        The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, is reportedly designing a sophisticated orbital technology that would allow the collection of enormous amounts of solar energy in space before beaming it down in concentrated form to remote US bases during military operations.
      
The joint AFRL-Northrop Grumman project, so far worthy of over $100 million in research cash, is dubbed the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstration and Research project (SSPIDR), The Stars & Stripes media outlet reported.
According to the demonstrations manager for the project, Maj. Tim Allen, cited by the media outlet, specialists are designing an elaborate system consisting of a constellation of satellites with solar panels consisting of about 10,000 square meters - almost the size of two football fields.
Developers said that the project would not solely be used for military purposes.
According to the SSPIDR developers, the technology would provide solar power through weather, regardless of latitude, and regardless of day and night.
