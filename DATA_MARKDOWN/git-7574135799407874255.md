The Broadway adaptation Alanis Morissette‘s ’90s alt-rock classic Jagged Little Pill began previews on Sunday (11/3) and gets its official opening on December 5. Three days before the opening, Alanis herself will do a one-night-only acoustic performance of the album at Harlem’s historic Apollo Theater (8/2). Tickets for what sounds like a very special show go on sale Friday (11/8) at 10 AM with Live Nation and mailing list presales starting Thursday (11/7) at 10 AM.
