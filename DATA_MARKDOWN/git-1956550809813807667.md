Chicken wings served in an ox-drawn cart? Topped with peanut M&Ms? And a soundtrack of pumping Indi-pop? Hitchki had us at Namaste.A funky, lively Indian restaurant and bar – and a relatively new one to Barsha Heights – Hitchki is playful, modern and absolutely not your grandmother’s local.Vibrant interiors of teal, purple and orange are matched by the eclectic menu, which opens with a “back in time” section designed to recall favourite dishes from diners’ childhoods, such as Maggi noodles with egg or chicken, and Emirates Pofaki cheese curl-topped roti with omelette.There’s a vast amount of dishes to choose from, all reasonably priced, with dedicated sections for “baos, momos and all”, rolls, flatbreads, potatoes in myriad guises and even chicken.From the latter “Angry Birds” section it’s the bhut jolokia wings and rings that arrives on that aforementioned ox-drawn cart. Coated in a sweet, but fiery barbecue sauce, these wings are as good as any – and don’t knock the chocolate-coated peanut garnish until you’ve paired it.Tandoori paneer in an achari marinade is superb – fragrant and creamy with a moreish char. Of the flatbreads, served either Turkish pide-, Levantine manakish- or Catalan coca-style, the bakra qiston pe pide is “Hitchki Recommended”.The menu might describe these as canoe-shaped, but prepare for something of more QE2-esque proportions, crammed with pulled lamb, fried onions and sprinkled with creamy goat’s cheese.For the less adventurous, the “butterly” dal makhani is just that – a 12-hour simmered bowl of creamy, salty lentils drizzled with ghee, served with crisp aloo tikki and piping hot mini kulcha.With fun vibes and food, great service and prices, Hitchki may literally translate as “hiccups”, but you’re unlikely to find any in the experience.WHAT IS IT...Seriously quirky Indian-fusion dishes and lively vibes in Barsha HeightsWHY GO...For chicken wings topped with M&Ms. Of course.
