Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the only member of the group of progressive first-term congresswomen nicknamed “the squad” who had not yet backed a Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime ally.
Ms. Pressley announced her decision in an email to supporters Wednesday afternoon, and released a corresponding video announcement.
“Elizabeth has made it her life’s work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people,” Ms. Pressley said in a statement. “We find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it.”
