As you might recall, September was the one-year anniversary of Switch Online. At Nintendo's financial results briefing today, president Shuntaro Fukukawa briefly addressed it saying how membership numbers had "steadily" increased since its launch.
He also touched on expanding the service and said how Nintendo would continue to "enhance" it to continue encouraging Switch users to try it out.
Prior to the one-year anniversary of the service, at a Q&A shareholder meeting in April, Nintendo confirmed the service had already passed 10 million subscribers. Since then, it's received the Super Nintendo Online service update, which has no doubt boosted subscriptions once again.
