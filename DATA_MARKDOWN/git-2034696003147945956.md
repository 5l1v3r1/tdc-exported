        Every week, we’re going to be introducing you to a brand new artist we’re going mad for here at NME Towers via our ego-busting Q&A, What’s Your Band Called, Mate? This week, London’s SWEAT on their mysterious roles, intergalactic rock operas and sounding like microchips.
      

        What’s your band called, mate?
      
“To finally end all this confusion we are called Sweat.”

        We are…
      
The Dentist, The Gambler, The Mathematician, The Nobleman, and The Wildcard
Bass, Vocals, Drums, Synth and Guitar – not in that order, it should be obvious which is which!

        What do you sound like?
      
“Microwaved microchips.”

        Are you any good (honestly)?
      
“Good Good double good!”

        What’s your best song?
