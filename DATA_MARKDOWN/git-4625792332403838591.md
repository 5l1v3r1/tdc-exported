Rep. Matt Gaetz did not take kindly to a mocking tweet from Matthew Dowd, calling the longtime political strategist "the definition of useless."
Dowd, who works as a political analyst for ABC News, took aim at the Florida Republican on Friday. "I just want to stick up for Rep. Matt Gaetz, he is definitely not a tool. Tools are useful," he said on Twitter.
Hours later, Gaetz fired back. "I was overwhelmingly elected to Congress. Twice. Iâ€™ve served nearly a decade in public office, earning voter trust every 2 yrs," he said. "You are appointed by corporate media 2 spread the very nonsense voters rejected when they elected Trump. Your views are the definition of useless."
