Colors TV’s popular reality TV show Bigg Boss on Tuesday deferred the broadcast of the episode, in which its Monday night promo had predicted about the shock announcement on Siddharth Shukla’s eviction. Tuesday night’s promo also carried the controversial fight between Siddharth and Mahira Sharma, but it shockingly dropped the reference to ghar se beghar (eviction) from the warning issued by Bigg Boss. This is largely seen as the makers of the show having a second thought on evicting Siddharth, who is arguably the most popular contestant in the house.
The promo on Siddharth’s reported eviction had evoked angry reactions from Twitterati with many of whom even threatening to stop watching the show without Siddharth.
