Former cabinet minister Ed Vaizey has announced he will step down at the December general election.
Calling it “one of the hardest [decisions] I have ever taken”, Vaizey said the time was right to move on.
“I am passionate about the arts, our creative industries and technology and I want to specialise in these sectors,” he wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
“Let me make one thing clear: I am and will remain an enthusiastic supporter of you as our Prime Minister,” he added.

“I believe that your One Nation agenda is the right path for the Conservative Party, and will be working hard to help my successor, party and Prime Minister achieve a decent majority.”
