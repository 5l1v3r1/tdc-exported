The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday suggested thatÂ the new US sanctions against Tehran are useless, stressing that the unilateral measures reveal the helplessness and inability of the Trump administration to use diplomacy.
The US Department of Treasury imposed the new restrictions against Iran on the 40th anniversary of the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants, as over fifty Americans were held hostage for 444 days.
Relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated after the Trump administration abruptly declared in 2018 its unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as Iran nuclear deal, and the resumption of sanctions against Iran.
A year later, Tehran began a gradual abandonment of its commitments to the JCPOA which is currently in its third stage.
Meanwhile, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said earlier that Iran had increased its uranium production by more than tenfold in the last two months. He made that announcement ahead of the fourth step of Iran terminating its commitments to the JCPOA, expected to be announced this week.
