The death toll among horses at Santa Anita Park racetrack in Southern California now stands at 37 since last December after a horse was euthanized Saturday following an injury during the last race of the Breeder’s Cup.
Mongolian Groom was put down away from the track after a serious injury to his left hind leg in the $6 million race. A green screen around the ailing 4-year-old gelding blocked spectators at the track and watching on television from witnessing the gruesome scene.
