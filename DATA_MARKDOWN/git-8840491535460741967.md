CASTLEBAR, Mayo's county town, is celebrating its first GAA All-Star award.
It was presented last night to 25-year-old Castlebar Mitchels ace Patrick Durcan for his accomplished performances for Mayo throughout the 2019 season.
He was chosen at No. 5 in the half-back line in a team dominated by All-Ireland champions Dublin.
Durcan was singled out for being so adept at launching attacks as well as being so solid defensively.
The adjudication panel also described him as one of the sport's most consistent performers.
A statement issued by his club, Castlebar Mitchels, said it was very proud of Patrick's achievements.
