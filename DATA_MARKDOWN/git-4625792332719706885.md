New video from inside ABC studios show host Amy Robach claiming she had the story about Jeffrey Epstein and his predatory behavior three years ago, but the network did not want to air it.
The video, released Tuesday by Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, shows Robach on set explaining to someone off-camera what she knew about the Epstein story.
"I've had the story for three years. I've had this interview with Virginia Roberts. We would not put it on the air," the anchor said in the video. "First of all, I was told, 'Who is Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the Palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways. We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will that we, that also quashed the story."
