TRINITY Sport, in association with Bank of Ireland, officially unveiled its sport scholars for the 2019-2020 season at an event for family and friends in the Dining Hall, Trinity College Dublin.
This year’s awardees, comprising of 40 Trinity Sport scholars and 25 Club Academy scholars, include Mayo athlete and human genetics student Sorcha McAllister.
Sorcha was recognised for her achievements in athletics. She is the current national Under 23 1,500m champion and represented Ireland at the European Under 23 cross country championship.
Special guests on the night included Trinity Sport ambassador and motivational speaker Mark Pollock who spoke to the Trinity Sport scholars about the importance of collaboration, commenting: “Being involved in sports during my time in Trinity is what taught me how to win and lose, how to build resilience and how to be part of a team. I believe these skills not only matter in sport, but can be applied in business, science and life in general.”
