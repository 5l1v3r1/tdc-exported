Lewis Hamilton believes he is yet to reach his peak as he prepares to be crowned champion of the world for a sixth time.
Hamilton’s parents have flown from Stevenage to the United States to watch their son’s inevitable coronation, including father Anthony, the driving force behind Lewis’ career – their relationship patched-up after a turbulent period.
The British driver needs to finish only eighth in Austin on Sunday to be certain of the title that will move him ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio and within one of Michael Schumacher’s record haul of seven.
