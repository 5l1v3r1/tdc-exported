Rahat Fateh Ali Khan recently sat down for a chat with BBC Asian Network’s Haroon Rashid and talked about many things, including his sell-out UK tour and Coke Studio, the quality of which, he feels, has dwindled over the years.
“The earlier Coke Studio seasons that Rohail Hyatt was producing were very good. After that, it was good but it became worse over time,” said the iconic singer, when asked about his hits from the show. Rahat patted his own shoulder, saying that he did well on songs like Afreen Afreen, but seemed unsure of the song selection in later seasons. “I did well, but I was going to do well, regardless. I’m not talking about myself but the overall show. We have to perform well, but some things happen that are wrong. They went wrong with the song selection,” he explained.
