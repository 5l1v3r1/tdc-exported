A decision on whether to proceed with the controversial HS2 rail project appears to have been pushed back until after the upcoming General Election, amid uncertainty over how it will feature in party manifestos.
Lord Tony Berkeley, the deputy chairman of the official review into the high-speed rail scheme, said the report remains unfinished, with days to go until pre-election restrictions on what the civil service can publish come into effect.

Douglas Oakervee, who is writing the review, has yet to show his final draft to either Berkeley and the other panel members, or to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.
It remains unclear how the Tories will approach HS2 in their election campaign, with business secretary Andrea Leadsom leading calls for the project to be scrapped. It is due to link London and the West Midlands in a first phase delivered in 2026, before a second phase connects Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester by 2033.
Earlier this autumn Shapps revealed that the costs may spiral to £88bn by 2019 prices, against a budget of just over £62bn.
Berkely tweeted: “We are told that, when completed by Doug Oakervee and the Department for Transport secretariat, it will be locked into the DfT vaults for the new secretary of state to publish.”
Until then, he said, his role as deputy to Oakervee had finished, with the report still unfinished and “no opportunity [for Berkeley] to influence conclusions”.
