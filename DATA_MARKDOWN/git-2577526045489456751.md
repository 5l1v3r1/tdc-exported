Five Super Smash Bros. Ultimate pros recently shared their thoughts on which character they think is the strongest, and some of their answers are surprising.
“I think the best character is clearly Joker now,” said Smash streamer and top Smash 4 player Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios, citing the domination of fellow pro and Joker player Leonardo “MKLeo” Lopez. Lopez has been on a tear since Smash Ultimate’s release, winning most major tournaments. “If I have to ask myself which character is the best, I only have results to go by.”
That said, Lopez started out playing the fighters Lucina and Ike and still dominated with them. When asked which character he thinks is best, Lopez said that he doesn’t think it’s Joker. “I just think I’m good. He’s still really good, but he’s not the best.”
Other pros interviewed in the video cited Wolf and Snake as their top fighters. One mentioned the newer fighter Hero and cited his “Hocus Pocus” ability, which randomly grants Hero a special power, like making him enormous or invisible. (Some tournaments have wrestled with the idea of banning Hero due in part to the randomness of attacks like this one.)
