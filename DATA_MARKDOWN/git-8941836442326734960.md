PHOENIX (AP) - Phoenix police are urging parents and others to closely examine Halloween candy.
An advisory sent out by the Phoenix Police Department says the notice comes in response to reports that other law enforcement agencies in the state have received, saying candy appears contaminated.
Police say to be vigilant in looking for damaged wrapping and unwrapped candy. They also say to look closely at homemade items they received.
They say if there’s any doubt about a treat, to throw it out and to report suspicious items to authorities.
