The body behind the Oscars has come under fire after banning Nigeria’s first submission for best international feature film.
Genevieve Nnaji’s Lionheart, which was acquired by Netflix, was disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences because it did not meet the criteria for the category, which was recently renamed from best foreign language film.
Submitted films must be predominantly in a foreign language, and Lionheart is mostly in English, apart from a small section which is in the Igbo language.
