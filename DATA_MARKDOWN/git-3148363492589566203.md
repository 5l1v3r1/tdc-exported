Mr Khan told the Evening Standard: “The time is right for our society to have an evidence-based conversation about cannabis — about the law, how it is enforced, and how we support those struggling with addiction.
“It goes without saying that I will continue to support the police to enforce the law as it stands, but all Londoners will benefit if we can start a conversation that leads to a reduction in violent crime.”
The Labour mayor said that there is a “clear link” between the rise in the drugs market and increasing violent crime across the United Kingdom. Khan made the comments after the capital saw its 122nd murder on Friday.
London is on course to exceed last year’s murder rate, which was itself a ten-year high.
