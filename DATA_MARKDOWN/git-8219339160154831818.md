Ubiquiti’s UniFi is out today with Dream Machine which combines a WiFi router and Gigabit switch for both home or business use. It has an integrated 4-port Gigabit Ethernet switch, advanced security gateway with IDS/IPS and DPI, works in high-density environments, and is scalable with UniFi’s access points to fit almost any size deployment.

The integrated switch makes it a solid choice for both smart home users who need to connect hubs and more to power HomeKit devices as well as IT admins who are running business/enterprise networks.
Dream Machine also features an advanced security gateway and an integrated cloud key to easily map out networks, manage network traffic, and more.
