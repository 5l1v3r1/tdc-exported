        Ethereum (ETH) has faced the dilemma of moving to proof-of-stake in the usual way – by another delay in the mining “ice age”. For the past three years, developers have voted several times to disable the difficulty time bomb, so that miners could get some grace time to seek block rewards.
      
The next likely delay of the difficulty time bomb will happen for the Berlin hard fork, which is scheduled for June 2020. The Istanbul hard fork, which is expected in December 2019, will also go without the final drive to abandon mining.
