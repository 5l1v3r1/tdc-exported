LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 ― With its release later this month, Disney has released a new trailer to announce ticket sales for highly anticipated Frozen II as well as the cover of Into the Unknown from punk pop band Panic! At the Disco.  
In the sequel, Elsa must find out the truth about her past and uncover the secrets surrounding her powers in a journey that will take her far from her kingdom of Arendelle.
The family favourite features the voices of Kristen Bell as Anna, Idina Menzel as Elsa, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, and Josh Gad as Olaf along with Rachel Wood and Sterling K. Brown as new additions.
The synopsis reads: “Why was Elsa born with magical powers? What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, she’ll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In Frozen, Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In Frozen II, she must hope they are enough.”
Frozen II is set for release here on November 21.
