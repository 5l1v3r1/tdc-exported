A lot of attention has been turned to the banking system this year as it battles to keep the economy afloat. The repo market is a huge red flag in the US, yet the government remains staunch in its policies on regulating the crypto industry. Ex-congressman and crypto stalwart Ron Paul has been talking about the future and it is not a pretty picture.
Host Naomi Brockwell sat down with the former congressman at the recent Litecoin summit to get his take on the ongoing battle between government and the crypto industry. In the NBTV interview, Dr Paul kicked off by stating that the government has a responsibility and has been messing up causing the depressions and recessions.
