A day after four White House officials refused to show up for closed door depositions on Capitol Hill, two more White House aides were expected to do the same on Tuesday, as Democrats said it was yet another example of the President stonewalling the Congress on questions involving Ukraine and Russian interference in the 2016 elections.
"This will be further evidence of an effort by the Administration to obstruct the lawful and constitutional duties of Congress," said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), as Democrats noted similar actions were part of impeachment charges drawn up against President Richard Nixon.
"We may infer by the White House obstruction here, that their testimony would be further incriminating of the President," Schiff told reporters on Monday.
"We have a series of shifting, ever-changing rationales for this campaign of obstruction," Schiff added.
