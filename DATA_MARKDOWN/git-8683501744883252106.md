Ever since the 1980s Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger have had something of a rivalry going. The pair were two of the biggest action stars of their era, which led to a significant competition between them. Now that rivalry has apparently heated back up, and Stallone is striking back.
In a recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Schwarzenegger repeated a claim that he had successfully tricked Stallone into making the infamous 1992 bomb, Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. The Terminator star says he told Stallone he was thinking of making the movie, even though he claims he knew it was terrible, and that Stallone jumped in and solidified the deal for himself when he thought his rival wanted the same gig.
Stallone apparently saw Schwarzenegger's appearance on the show, and didn't love being the but of the joke. He recently told Schwarzenegger via Twitter that he's writing a sequel that he wants Arnold to star in. Check out the details below.
