        MOSCOW (Sputnik) – The Ministry of Health of Fiji prevented the national futsal team from returning home after its match against the Kingdom of Tonga, which is currently facing an outbreak of measles, national media reported on Sunday.
      
The match was held as part of the Oceania Championships in New Caledonia, the FDC News media outlet reported. According to the Health Ministry, there are fears that the players and officials may have had contacts with people, infected with measles during the match, as the Tongan players have not been vaccinated.
