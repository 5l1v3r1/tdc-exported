SwiftKey Keyboard app for iOS just got updated in App Store. This version 2.7.0 update comes with two new improvements. First, SwiftKey now supports voice typing. Yes, when you prefer to speak instead of type, you can use this new voice typing feature in SwiftKey. This feature works only for English language users for now. If you have English as your language, after installing this update, you can just tap the new microphone icon to begin the voice typing experience. In order to enter punctuations explicitly, try saying “new line.” This new update also adds “trending” GIFs section in the GIF panel.
