Indian snacks major Haldiram's has signed up for e-commerce giant Amazon's global selling programme to sell its delicacies in the United States, the company revealed.

The e-commerce giant launched its global selling programme in India in 2015, cumulating exports worth $1 billion as of now, providing an opportunity to Indian sellers to grow and increase their product presence through e-commerce exports.
The programme is expected to generate $5 billion in cumulative export sales by 2023 for enrolled Indian exporters.
According to Amazon, nearly 50,000 Indian manufacturers, brands and traders are currently making use of its global e-commerce exports channel to sell 150 million products, across 12 Amazon international marketplaces.
In 1937, Haldiram's started as a small entity from the snacks city of Bikaner in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The brand now has a massive presence across India, serving ready-to-eat food products. The outlet found global success and is now present in nearly 80 countries.
