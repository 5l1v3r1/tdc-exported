        Trump’s appearance at UFC 224, which took place at Madison Square Garden on 2 November, apparently stole the show, as after the main fight between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, everyone seemed to be talking about only one thing – whether Trump had been booed or cheered by the audience.
      
UFC boss Dana White commented on President Donald Trump’s attendance at UFC 224, saying that the audience had treated Trump with respect. During the post-fight press conference, White responded to allegations that the president had been booed when he appeared in the arena, remarking that people in the United States are free to express themselves.
"Whoever you are, this is America. You can believe or do whatever you want. If you want to boo, you can boo. As an American, you can do whatever you want to do, and you can choose whatever side you want to be on”, Dana White said.
Multiple videos posted online show the spectators going crazy when the 45th president appears in the arena, with netizens and the public arguing whether Trump was being booed or cheered.
