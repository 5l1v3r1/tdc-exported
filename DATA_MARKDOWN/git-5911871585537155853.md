Conservative commentator Sebastian Gorka — who served as a Deputy Assistant to President Trump for a few months in 2017 — has had his YouTube channel banned thanks to Imagine Dragons, as The Daily Beast reports.
Gorka has a radio show called America First, and he typically uploaded those shows to YouTube after they aired. He continously kept playing the Imagine Dragons song “Radioactive” on the show, and Imagine Dragons lead singer Dan Reynolds has not been pleased.
