        Late-night hosts offer updates on Republicans’ mental gymnastics, the impeachment inquiry’s transcripts, and Trump’s border wall
      
Donald Trump has officially changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Florida, reported Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show. “Good riddance, Don,” he added. “Don’t let the door hit ya where the porn star spanked ya.”
According to Trump sources, the president is making the move primarily for tax reasons, but “just so we’re clear: Trump is leaving because of a tax problem he created,” Colbert explained, since New York state and local taxes went up because of the tax law Trump passed in late 2017.
In other words, his move to Florida is “the old fart in the elevator then take the stairs tactic”.
