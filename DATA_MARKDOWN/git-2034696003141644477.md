Harry Styles has revealed why he turned down the role of Prince Eric in Rob Marshall’s live-action remake of Disney‘s The Little Mermaid.
During an interview with Capital FM, Styles explained that he had met Marshall, whom the singer described as “the most wonderful man”, before the news broke that he was eyeing the role of Prince Eric in the movie.
According to Styles, there were a “few things” that they couldn’t work out. He also added that his upcoming plans for his music didn’t align with the film’s production schedule.
“I think it’s obviously going to be an amazing film,” Styles said. “But they shoot for so long and I wanna tour next year, maybe. I haven’t announced that yet, but yeah, it just didn’t quite line up.”
