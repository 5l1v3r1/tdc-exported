Teachers and students at Emsengeni Primary School in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, sung in full voice on Friday ahead of Saturday's Rugby World Cup final in which the Springboks and England are expected to lock horns for cup honours.
Bok captain Siya Kolisi is no stranger to the school having spent his earlier schooling years there before moving to Grey High School.
Flags aloft, children running around and educators clad in green and gold, the scenes at the primary school all pointed to a school rising for one of their own.
When News24 arrived, there were cameras aplenty and children were running around to get themselves in front of cameras, excitement reaching fever pitch.
