“Damn right it makes me angry,” Gabbard, a Democrat 2020 candidate for president, said in reaction to Trump’s foreign policy in the Middle East. She was speaking in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow on the Breitbart News Daily radio show on Sirius XM Patriot 125.
She said:
Gabbard endorsed the idea of getting back into the Iran nuclear deal reached by former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry.
“There are flaws in the Iran nuclear agreement, but we are better off being in the agreement,” she said, citing a preference for some level of access to monitor Iran’s nuclear activity.
She warned that President Trump’s increasing “draconian” sanctions on Iran and troop deployments in the area would only incite war between Iran and the United States
“We are not only pushing our country closer and closer to a war with Iran that would be far more devastating and costly than anything we saw with the war in Iraq,” she said.
