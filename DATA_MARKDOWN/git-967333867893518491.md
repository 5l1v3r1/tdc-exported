One person was killed and 18 people injured in a grenade attack on security forces in a market place in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday. The deceased is reported to be a vendor from the area.
This was the second grenade attack in the past fortnight in the same area of the city.  
Monday’s attack came when markets were open and traffic returned to normal in several parts of Srinagar, after three months of lockdown.
