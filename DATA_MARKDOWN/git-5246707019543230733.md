Nintendo abandoned first-party game support for the Wii many years ago, but to this day third-party publisher Ubisoft has continued to release its Just Dance series on the system. The latest one – Just Dance 2020 – arrived yesterday.
Of course, all good things must come to an end, and it now sounds as if Ubisoft will finally be dropping support for this particular generation of Nintendo hardware. According to a PR, Just Dance 2020 will be the last entry in the series for Wii. Ubisoft apparently went as far as saying it would be the last Wii game ever released.
