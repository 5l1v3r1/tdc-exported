Matt Okine and Alex Dyson have had it pretty good since they parted ways.
Dyson made a brief left turn into politics, running a campaign that he announced via interpretive dance, while Okine has had the sweet and gentle sitcom The Other Guy to keep him busy. Also, I saw Okine at Coles a couple of weeks ago, and he looked really well. So that’s good.
But, despite the success they’ve found as solo acts, there’s still been something ever so slightly missing — that tiny spark of Rat Dog magic that only happens when the two are in the room together. Well, looks like that magic is returning to our lives very soon. Yep, as announced in a predictably hilarious teaser promo, Matt and Alex have reunited once more — this time to take on the ARIA Awards.
