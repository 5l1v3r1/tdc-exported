Kendall Roy from Succession is hot.
I’ve got a thing for sad rich characters — I can admit that. It’s my punishment for being pro Chuck Bass when I was 14 and didn’t know any better. There’s unfortunately been a long line of sad rich, often hot, boys in my pop culture past.
It’s pretty easy to spot a sad hot rich boy on TV: their parents are either dead or emotionally abusive, they’re well educated, boyishly handsome, and I’m pretty sure floppy hair is mandatory. All of this tends to make them pretty isolated and tortured, with a reputation for being a bit of a bad boy.
Mr Darcy was probably my earliest introduction to the sad rich boy. After which, there was a quick succession (lol) of the archetype: Edward Cullen, the aforementioned Chuck Bass and Nate Archibald, Logan Echolls, and even John Barton from Looking for Alibrandi.
And see, I’ve been hot for them all — but there’s been a void in this category for a while that Succession’s Kendall Roy has somehow, inexplicably, filled.
My teenage years were full of sad rich boys, but as I have grown up, so has the trope. Kendall is no sad rich boy — he’s a sad rich MAN.
