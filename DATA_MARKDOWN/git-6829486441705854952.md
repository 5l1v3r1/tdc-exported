If you’re a woman in comedy, there’s one thing you can rely upon, like the phases of the moon, like taxes, like sweet death itself: and that’s the cursed comments of men.
It sounds hyperbolic, but lurking in any comments section, on any medium, like a scurrying mass of bugs under a noble rock, is just a swarm of men who feel the need to engage with whatever comedic content has been posted.
Imagine having a thought and keeping it to oneself? Revolutionary.
Anyway, Logan Guntzelman is a Los Angeles based comedian and writer, who recently had a Comedy Central stand-up special, which from the few snippets and things I have managed to find seems very very funny (the video is not available in our cursed country).
