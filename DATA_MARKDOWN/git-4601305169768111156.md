As evidence mounts that President Trump tied Ukraine aid to that country announcing a sham investigation into Trump's political rivals, some Republicans are backing off their claim there was no "quid pro quo". Instead, there was a quid pro quo, but there's nothing wrong with quid pro quos. Trump, of course, agrees with them.
Perhaps so.
The context is particularly damning testimony from a highly-placed national security official and GOP aides caught trying to out the original whistleblower's name.
A good example of the goalposts being loudly hauled comes courtesy of Ben Shapiro, the cool kids' philosopher:
The next version of the question is "whether it was a criminal quid pro quo" or simply "whether it is an impeachable quid pro quo" to which the only answer is "no."
