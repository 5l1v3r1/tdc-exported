        Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!
      
I was always intrigued by smart speakers, but I just didn’t see the point in them for a long time. Yeah, asking to set timers and about the weather was useful, but they always seemed hamstrung by the lack of a screen.
Using only your voice, things like changing tracks or browsing news sources was clumsy at best or impossible at worse. I just didn’t see the point.
Then, I got a smart speaker with a screen. And it changed my relationship with the tech completely. It had all the hands-free benefits of a normal voice-activated assistant, but the inclusion of a display just made it way, way more useful.
And — would you believe it — there’s currently a great offer on one of the best smart speakers with screens about: the Google Home Hub. Yep, rather than its normal price of $130, you can currently pick one up for only $70. Not bad, right?
