Republicans held slim majorities in the state House and Senate heading into election night.
The results indicate a major win for the Democrats, who now control every level of power in what was considered a swing state just a few years ago, The Hill said.
Dems now control all three statewide elected offices, both US Senate seats and both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats also hold seven of Virginia's eleven seats in the US House of Representatives.
Long a Republican-controlled state, the Democratic Party, in the wake of the rising unpopularity of the Trump administration, won control on Tuesday of the Virginia government for the first time since 1994.
