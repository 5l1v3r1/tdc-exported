Ruel’s fan base are passionate and ready to take down any boomer who talks shit about the pop wunderkind — even if that boomer is Richard Kingsmill, triple j’s group music director.
Things started innocently enough: yesterday, triple j tweeted out they’d be broadcasting a Live At The Wireless recorded at Ruel’s recent headline show at Sydney’s Hordern Pavilion.
Kingsmill had to butt in to refute their claim it was the loudest crowd ever with a (very tongue-in-cheek) tweet that the ABC Fact Check department has confirmed Billie Eilish’s crowds were “one decibel higher”.
The fans did not like this, and soon Kingsmill was inundated with 100s of messages telling him to shut up and go and pack his kids’ lunches. They also argued that Eilish’s crowd was louder because it was filled with “locals”, as opposed to Ruel’s fans, who are not basic.
