Brighton extended their winning run at the Amex Stadium to three matches with a 2-0 win over struggling Norwich.
The Seagulls had to wait for their first home win of the season, against Tottenham on October 5, but have now followed it up with wins over Everton and Norwich.
Graham Potterâ€™s side were made to wait until deep into the second half to break the deadlock but went ahead as Leandro Trossard poked the ball past Tim Krul for his second league goal of the season.
And Brighton sealed the three points in the 84th minute when Shane Duffy slid in to tap home a Trossard free-kick.
In contrast, Norwich have lost five of their last six, and remain second from bottom having amassed just seven points from 11 matches.
The Canaries remain without a win since their shock victory over Manchester City on September 14 and have managed to secure just one point away from Carrow Road in the Premier League this season.
