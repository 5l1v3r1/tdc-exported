Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is using his first campaign ad as a 2020 Senate candidate in Alabama to try moving past his strained relationship with President Trump, saying the president “has my full support.”
During a Thursday appearance on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight," Sessions announced plans to enter the 2020 race for the Alabama Senate seat he held before joining the Trump administration. Fox News also obtained Sessions’ first campaign video.
In the ad, Sessions addressed the camera and said, “When I left President Trump’s Cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president? Nope. Have I said a cross word about our president? Not one time.”
Continuing, he said, “I’ll tell you why: First, that would be dishonorable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the president is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support.”
