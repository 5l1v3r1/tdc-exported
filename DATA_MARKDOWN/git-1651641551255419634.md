        Three games are coming to PlayStation Now this November, with two marquee games available for a limited time and one game set to stay.
      
PlayStation Now received a huge price drop back at the start of October, with subscription prices being cut almost in half in most regions and a new feature known as “marquee games” being added. Subscribers to PlayStation Now have access to over 800 PlayStation 2, 3, and 4 games, which can be played on both PlayStation 4 and Windows PC thanks to the power of cloud gaming.
For those out of the loop: PlayStation Now’s marquee games are games that will rotate back out of the service after a set period of time – hence the term “marquee games.”
Heading the lineup is the iconic Persona 5, which will be available to download (PlayStation 4 only) and stream until the 4th of February, 2020. Yes – you can finally play Persona 5 on your Windows PC thanks to the power of game streaming!
