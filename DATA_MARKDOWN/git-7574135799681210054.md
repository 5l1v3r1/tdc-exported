        THE FOOTBALL RAMBLE
      
UK-based podcast The Football Ramble, featuring Luke Moore, Marcus Speller, Pete Donaldson and JIm Campbell, is heading across the pond for its first-ever North American live tapings where audiences can expect discussions on English Premier League, World Football, and how Americans are wrong to call football “soccer.” Says Moore: “We are beyond excited to be the first UK football podcast to play live theatre shows in the US, and have plenty of tricks up our sleeve to really make each show a night to remember. Expect lots of laughs, plenty of soccer chat and more than a few surprises as we bring our roadshow stateside for the first time ever. Marcus, Jim, Pete and I can’t wait to get cracking. It’s going to be a real experience. See you there, America!” The tour hits NYC’s Gramercy Theatre on November 5, Brooklyn’s Murmrr Theatre on 11/6, Toronto’s Danforth Music Hall on 11/7, and Chicago’s Thalia Hall on 11/8.
