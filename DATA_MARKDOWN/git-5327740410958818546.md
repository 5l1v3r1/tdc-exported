“Meet Your Muslim Neighbour promises to be a unique and fun-filled afternoon about Islam and the Muslim community,” association chairman Dr. Farhan Haque wrote to Peace Arch News.

“They’re from Pakistan, they’re from India, from Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia, all different backgrounds,” he said at the time.
