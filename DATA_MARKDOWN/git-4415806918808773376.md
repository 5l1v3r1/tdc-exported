Drug cartel gunmen in Mexico have ambushed three vehicles along a dirt road, slaughtering at least six children and three women, all of them US citizens living in the north of the country.
The grisly attack left one of their vehicles a burned-out, bullet-riddled hulk, authorities said today and the dead included eight-month-old twins.
At least five other youngsters were wounded by gunfire.
Mexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo said the attackers may have mistaken the group’s large vehicles for those of rival gangs.
But all of the victims were believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family, who live in a decades-old settlement founded by an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and had problems with drug traffickers over the years.
A LeBaron was killed a decade ago after denouncing the cartels.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump immediately offered to help Mexico “wage war on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth”.
