SALISBURY, Md. (AP) — Repeated racially and sexually offensive messages written inside a Maryland university building have left students scared and demanding action from officials.
News outlets report the latest offensive message inside Fulton Hall at Salisbury University read, “Sandy Hook comes to SU kill (racial slur).” Pictures of the message were spread on social media sparking outrage among the students. The message references the 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school.
Sophomore Jamil Charles says students don’t feel safe. He says school leaders are brushing the problem away and sending emails to placate the students.
University spokesman Jason Rhodes says the school can’t comment because the investigation is ongoing but says the university is bolstering security.
Crime Solvers is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
