        Mercedes boss Toto Wolff says that his driver Lewis Hamilton is still motivated to keep going and keep winning after the Brit secured his sixth world title on Sunday at the United States Grand Prix. Hamilton has won ten races this season and his title made it five in the last six years, putting himself outright second on the list of F1's most successful drivers.
      
Wolff has been Hamilton's team boss for five of those titles, so understands that the 34-year old is still as determined as ever for success.
He said: "Taking his sixth drivers' title is a truly remarkable and special achievement. You can see how motivated Lewis still is, he wants to win every race and get the best result possible.

        "It's not been an easy year, with tough competition and the loss of Niki. I'd like to think Niki's looking down on us, tipping his cap after today's result. Valtteri drove an absolutely faultless race today, he has been on incredible form all weekend and he thoroughly deserved the victory.
      

        "Lewis fought back in style and put in a great drive to go from P5 to P2."
