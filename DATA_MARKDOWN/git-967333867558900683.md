        US President Donald Trump confirmed on Twitter Thursday night that he would be moving his permanent residence to Palm Beach, Fla., blaming local New York leaders for the move, who the president argued had treated him "very badly."
      
In a series of tweets, Trump wrote that the Empire State would "always have a special place" in his heart, while adding that "few have been treated worse" by its leadership despite paying "millions" in taxes.
