“I have some more bad news for the president,” said Jimmy Kimmel his opening monologue. “According to a new Washington Post, ABC News poll, all five of the top Democratic candidates are polling ahead of him.”
The left-wing TV funnyman added that in addition to candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, Kimmel allegedly polling ahead of the president, a few other entities also had a chance at winning the 2020 election, including “a tube of warm coleslaw” and “genital herpes.”
