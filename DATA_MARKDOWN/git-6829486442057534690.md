Jenny Slate doesn’t get stage fright because she’s worried that she isn’t funny. In her new Netflix special — part stand-up, part documentary — she explains that her nerves come down to that fundamental question we all ask: “will they like me?”
“And I know they will, once I start talking,” she says, talking back-stage. “But I don’t earn the love, unless I give something beautiful that goes out. So my stage fright comes from a deeper thing, of, like, exchange. ”
Slate is someone who gives a lot to her work, which is why Stage Fright never loses steam even as it jolts between stand-up bits and interviews with her family.
Tender, revealing and far from afraid to be stupid, Slate’s warmth to herself — whether looking through childhood possessions or joking about her recent divorce — is utterly infectious. Stage Fright calls on us to treat ourselves with respect, even when it feels like our world (personal, political, environmental) is crashing down.
