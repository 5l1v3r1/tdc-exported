Glam-punks HMTLD opened a recent east London gig with typical eccentricity.

The ensuing show (comprised of equal parts industrial, glam-stomp, ‘Low’-era Bowie, New Romanticism and accessible pop) proved that the London art-pop provocateurs have lost none of their swagger since NME dubbed them “the UK’s most thrilling new band” two years ago.
