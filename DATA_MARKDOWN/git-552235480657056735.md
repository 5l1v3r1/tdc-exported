A proud Coatbridge gran has praised her granddaughter for donating three wigs’ worth of hair to the Princess Trust to mark her 60th birthday.
St Andrew’s High School pupil Suvi Adams chopped off 30-inches of her long locks at the birthday bash with the help of hairdresser Lynn McGowan.
Gran Geraldine McAlinden said she was delighted with the kind-hearted youngster’s charitable efforts – which has raised around £200 so far.
However, she said she was happiest with Suvi’s efforts to provide three real-hair wigs for in-need kids.

Geraldine told the Advertiser: “Suvi was known for having her really long hair and even on the night we were saying to her she doesn’t have to do it; but she wanted to help.
“It’s a big deal for someone who is in high school to chop their hair right back like that.
“She really wanted to do it and said it would grow again; it was very brave of her to get it cut right down.
“It was a really nice birthday surprise for me.”
