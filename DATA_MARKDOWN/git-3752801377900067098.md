The University of South Africa (Unisa) has found that comments made by a senior lecturer on Twitter are offensive and contain racist undertones.
The institution has called for action to be taken against her.
Unisa issued the statement on Friday, two days after Professor Tracey McKay lambasted National Student Financial Aid Fund (NSFAS) recipients on the social media site.

At the time, McKay was responding to Twitter user Roman Cabanac who had earlier asked how textbook sales could fall if NFSAS gave students R5 000 to spend on books. 
She wrote she wished students funded through NSFAS were copying the books.
McKay claimed she was sure that the money was being used on "entertainment, wigs, nail polish and other student essentials".
She added that "even before this cash payment, the students would buy the books and immediately sell them", further tweeting that she worked in academia and the vast majority of students she had taught were the kind that bought wigs.
