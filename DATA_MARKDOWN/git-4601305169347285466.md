Last month, the "Wizard Rock," an iconic 1-ton boulder, mysteriously vanished without a trace from Arizona's Prescott National Forest. It was the third boulder disappearance in the region over the last few months. Now, Prescott National Forest officials report that the Wizard Rock has mysteriously returned. From CNN:
Seems to me they should check with the local interdimensional Bigfoot.
