LAHORE: All public and private schools have been closed in Lahore today due to high levels of smog.
The Punjab government took the late-night decision after a sudden spike in Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) from less than 200 to more than 500.
“All Schools of Lahore (public and private) to remain closed tomorrow [on] November 7, 2019,” said Provincial Minister for School Education Dr Murad Raas in a tweet.
He added, “Smog [is] at abnormally high levels right now in Lahore. [The government is] continuously monitoring the situation. Please refrain from taking the kids outdoors unless it is absolutely necessary. Will update.”
Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar also directed the concerned staff to enhance efforts to control crop burning besides undertaking other steps to curb smog in the city.
