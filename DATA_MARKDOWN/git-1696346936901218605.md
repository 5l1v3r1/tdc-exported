        Crypto exchange Binance has taken some major steps in setting new standards for cryptocurrency services. Adding support for the Ukrainian national currency, signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Ukrainian government, and implementing a cryptographic protocol for distributed key generation and signing â€“ these are only a few achievements of the company led by Changpeng Zhao (CZ).
      
Last month, we reported that Binance added the first fiat pairs, allowing users to buy Bitcoin, Binance Coin, and BUSD with Naira, the national currency of Nigeria. Back then, CZ said that more fiat currencies would follow, and he meant it.
Yesterday, the CEO announced in a tweet that the crypto exchange platform enabled deposits and withdrawals of Hryvnia (UAH), the national currency of Ukraine. Users will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with UAH starting from today.
