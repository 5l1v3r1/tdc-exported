Airbnb has vowed to ban “party houses” in the wake of a deadly shooting at a rented property in California.
In a series of tweets on Saturday, Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky said the San Francisco-based company is stepping up efforts to “combat unauthorised parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct”.
He said Airbnb is expanding manual screening of “high risk” reservations that are flagged by its system, and is also forming a rapid response team dedicated to house parties.
The company will remove guests who fail to comply, Mr Chesky said.
