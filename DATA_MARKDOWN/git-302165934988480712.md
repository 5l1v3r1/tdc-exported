SEATTLE, Nov 7 — A code update for PC gaming network Steam suggests that its operator, Valve Corporation, is readying for a move into cloud gaming.
Changes to the signup process for Steam Network’s game developing partners now make explicit mention of Cloud Gaming, per independent site tracker SteamDB.
The website updates, archived to the SteamDB Github repository, ask developers to agree to the terms of a Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum.
