Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari on Wednesday condemned PML-N leader Talal Chaudhry's sexist and derogatory remarks about Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Kanwal Shozab on a live television show.
In a tweet posted today, Mazari said: "Talal [Chaudhry] and his cohorts including [Khawaja] Asif abuse women in and out of parliament and don't have the moral courage to apologise."
