Actress Jane Fonda was arrested for the fourth week in a row in Washington, D.C., while advocating for congressional climate change action at the United States Capitol.
Fonda, 81, was arrested Friday afternoon alongside fellow actresses Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Kenner, both 60. Fonda was arrested at the Capitol last week with actor Ted Danson, 71, and the week before with Grace & Frankie co-star Sam Waterston, 78.
