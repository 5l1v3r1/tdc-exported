Jackson McHenry: We’re here because we’ve had to organize an emergency discussion. There was simply no other way around it. When we saw the first few episodes of Dickinson, we were intrigued by the show’s wobbly but clever tone and the way it blends the past with the present. But now that we’ve watched the show’s whole first season, we have to admit that we feel like we’re being trolled. It’s concerning, frankly.
Kathryn VanArendonk: The first moment I suspected that Dickinson was somehow sneaking into my room at night and stealing my deepest unspoken desires from the dark recesses of my brain was in episode three. Emily, high on opium while at a house party, gets her period and collapses in despair. She drags herself across the room like she’s dying, and then stuffs her sister’s handmade cat pillow between her legs because the idea of going downstairs for an actual sanitary napkin is just too hard. This was when I suspected that the show was, in fact, coming specifically for me.
