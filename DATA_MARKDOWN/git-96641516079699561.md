This week it's all about computers in our ears, or hearables, if you prefer. Apple announced the long-awaited AirPods Pro on Tuesday, but even though they helped popularize wireless earbuds, now just about every tech company has their own pair as well. We chat about what's new with the AirPods Pro, as well as how to find the perfect pair of earbuds for you. Plus, we talk about the state of smartwatches. (Note: This episode was recorded before Google's Fitbit acquisition was confirmed.)
