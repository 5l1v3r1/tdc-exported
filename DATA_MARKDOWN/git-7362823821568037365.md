If Goldfinger had a toilet, it would probably resemble this nearly $1.3 million gem-encrusted, golden john that surfaced at a Shanghai trade fair last week.
The lavish loo is gunning for a Guinness World Record for most diamonds in a toilet seat (yes, that’s a category) with over 40,000 adorning its bulletproof rim — as if all the gold wasn’t ostentatious enough.
