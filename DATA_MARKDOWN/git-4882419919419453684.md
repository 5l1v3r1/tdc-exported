Barcelona are planning for next season and one player they are keeping a close on is Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz, although he won't come cheap or easy.
Barça have been following the young German international and on Wednesday were present as Leverkusen beat Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the champions league.
Havertz produced another good performance and there are few left with doubts that he will be one of the best players in international football in the coming years.
The Catalan club have been exhaustively following him this season. They've missed very few of his games and sent a bigger delegation for the midweek clash with Atletico.
However, they know it won't be easy to sign him given interest from Bayern Munich and Manchester United, among others, who are both ready to make a huge effort to sign the attacking midfielder.
Right now, he's expected to go for close to, if not more than €100 million because there are teams ready to pay that.
Bayer Leverkusen are aware that this season could be Havertz's last with the club and hope to sell to the biggest bidder. Barça will be one of the clubs in the auction and the game is just getting started.
