        XRP, the digital asset related to Ripple’s network, remains stagnant, despite expectations that the Swell conference on November 6-7 would bring price action. Despite the numerous mentions on social media, XRP remains subdued and stuck to a price of around $0.29.
      
The Swell conference is almost here accompanied by outlandish price predictions, with XRP’s possibility to grow to as high as $8. But the asset has failed to even get close to its annual high around $0.47. For now, XRP is below even the levels of January, when the price hovered around $0.36.
Some of the expectations for the ascent of XRP is that it would somewhat find a use case in the legacy financial system. Some predict the asset would work as a leading currency, in a wildly rare scenario.
