        Just a few days after rumours started to swirl about a sequel to Overwatch being announced at BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard has officially announced Overwatch 2.
      
Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, is still a multiplayer game. However, the key difference is that this time players are working together, not against each other.
You can watch a special cinematic, Zero Hour, below.
