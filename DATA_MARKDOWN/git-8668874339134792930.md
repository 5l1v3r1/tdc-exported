Sonny Bill Williams’ paycheck at the Toronto Wolfpack will be the value of an entire Super League salary cap thanks to a dispensation allowed within their league’s salary cap regulations.
Williams has signed a two-year deal worth around £2.6 million per year with Toronto, a move that would see him stay in the game until the 2021 RL World Cup.
With the Super League salary cap set at £2 million, his bumper wage bill is worth more than an entire team’s allowance. The 34-year-old star’s reported pay packet is in fact 40 times that of the average Super League player (£65,000).
The New Zealander will almost certainly come under the ‘Marquee Player’ rule, which states: ‘Each Super League and Championship Club is permitted to have two Marquee Players whose Salary Cap Value is limited to £150,000 (or £75,000 if Club Trained).’
