KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Malaysia will allow ride-hailing firms such as Indonesia’s Go-jek to start operations on a limited scale from January 2020, Malaysia’s transport minister said today.
Go-jek, whose backers include Alphabet’s Google and Chinese tech companies Tencent and JD, will start operating based on a proof-of-concept to measure demand for the service over six months, Minister Anthony Loke said. — Reuters
