One of Ireland's youngest killers has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of schoolgirl Ana Kriegel.
Two 15-year-old boys - known as Boy A and Boy B - were found guilty in June of murdering the 14-year-old.
The schoolgirl's naked body was found in an abandoned farmhouse in Lucan, Co Dublin, last May after she had been reported missing by her parents.
Boy A was sentenced at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Tuesday to life, with a review period after 12 years.
He was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault and will be placed on the sex offenders register.
