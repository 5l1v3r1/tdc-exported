Late-night hosts addressed the shifting testimony from Gordon Sondland and Trump’s latest instance of bragging at a rally.
The host of Jimmy Kimmel Live started by covering Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. Sondland’s original testimony on allegations that Trump demanded a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, represented a denial – but Sondland now claims his memory has changed.
“I wonder what jogged his memory?” Kimmel asked. “Maybe he started taking those omega-3 supplements. They say they’re very effective against perjury.”
