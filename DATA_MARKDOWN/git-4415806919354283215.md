Raul Jimenez was on hand to head home a late leveller for Wolves as Arsenal let a lead slip for the third time in a week to increase pressure on head coach Unai Emery.
The Gunners appeared to have put the issues surrounding Granit Xhaka to one side, the midfielder watching from home after swearing at supporters last week, when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck, but a 1-1 draw here means Emery has overseen a run of two wins from the last nine Premier League games.
The Gabon striker – captain with Xhaka absent – took on the mantle and turned in his 50th Arsenal goal but the hosts were timid in attack and once again failed to keep a clean sheet as Jimenez rose to header in an equaliser with 14 minutes remaining to earn Wolves a deserved share of the spoils.
