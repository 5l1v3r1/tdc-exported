The 'Emsengeni Primary School' sign at the school in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, has 'SK' at the bottom to recognise Springbok captain Siya Kolisi's contribution towards it.
Inside the school premises, the boisterous sounds of laughing and excited children welcome News24 journalists.
Teachers dressed in assortments of green and gold smile and turn their attention to the journalists.
The mood is a good one. It's a happy one.
The principal at the school, Luyanda Nyoka, moves from the cameras to take calls. He is in high demand on Friday.
