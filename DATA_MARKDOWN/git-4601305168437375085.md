For years, Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner have been suing Universal to get paid, citing Universal's blatantly crooked bookkeeping (Shearer received $98 in music royalties and $81 in merchandising income from the film).
Now, the group has settled with Universal, presumably for less than the $400m named in the suit.
The settlement details aren't public, but UMG will continue to distribute Spinal Tap's music and the rights to the music will be reverted to the creators..."eventually."
