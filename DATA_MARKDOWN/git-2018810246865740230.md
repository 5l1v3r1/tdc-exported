Pro-gamer Fuudo is a world-class Street Fighter players around. Yuka Kuramochi is a very popular pin-up model. The couple just announced their marriage. The two became friends in an arcade and thanks to a Street Fighter IV tournament.
Though there is this humorous image floating around with Kuramochi and her future husband sitting despondently in a chair, the two had actually met way before thisâ€”prior to the Razer endorsements and even before Fuudo went pro.
