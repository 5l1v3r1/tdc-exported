Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Romney urged the Mexican government to “go after” the cartel gunmen behind the ambush attack on nine relatives who belong to the LeBaron family, a Mormon community long settled in northern Mexico.
“It’s moms and children. This is really unthinkable. And I agree with the president when he says that Mexico needs to really knuckle down and go after these cartels, and stop this escalating levels of violence,” said the Utah Republican.
“And [I do] hope that if there’s a way we can help in that effort, that we are called upon to do so,” he added.
