        New Delhi (Sputnik): While terming India an “exclusive strategic defence partner”, Russian Defence Minister General Sergey Shoigu reaffirmed his country’s commitment to extending all possible support in enhancing India’s defence capabilities, including cooperation in advanced and cutting-edge technology.
      
Russia has agreed to assist India on upgrading its formidable fleet of Su-30MKI jets with advanced weapons and avionics, which will lend the aircraft unmatched stealth features.
As per a consensus reached at the 19th India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, Russia will provide support in developing a prototype at a state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) facility, industry sources said.
“The Su-30 MKI upgrade programme will start soon", sources said without revealing details about the programme.
Sputnik had reported in the recent past that the entire fleet of 272 fighter jets will be upgraded and equipped with advanced weapons systems such as the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, the R-27P high-range infrared homing system, and Russian air-to-air missiles.
