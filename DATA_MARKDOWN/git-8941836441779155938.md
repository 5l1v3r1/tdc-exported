READING, Mass. (AP) - A boil water order imposed in a Boston suburb after a water sample tested positive for E. coli has been lifted.
The state Department of Environmental Protection said Monday it’s determined that drinking water in Reading, Massachusetts no longer poses a public health threat.
Officials say residents should flush their water systems to clear any potentially contaminated water.
They also say any beverages, ice, uncooked foods and baby formula made with tap water collected on or after Oct. 31 should be discarded.
The town is investigating what caused the contamination. The order was imposed Friday and officials distributed bottled water over the weekend.
E. coli bacteria can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea and headaches. Infants, elderly people and those with weak immune systems are especially impacted.
