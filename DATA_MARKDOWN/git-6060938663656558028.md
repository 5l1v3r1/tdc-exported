LUCKNOW: A cricket carnival is around as 'hosts' Afghanistan look to take their cricket forward against the touring West Indians at the Ekana cricket stadium.
With both the sides camping in the city for the month-long series, the fun fare will start on Wednesday with the opening One-dayer.
Afghanistan, who have made the city their third home in India, play three ODIs, three T20Is and a one-off Test here.
Having won the practice game on Monday, the Afghans will feel a little confident against a side which has the fire-power to blast any team in the shorter versions of the game.
But with Chris Gayle, Carlos Brathwaite, Fabian Allen and Kemar Roach not part of the squad, West Indies will have to search for alternatives.
