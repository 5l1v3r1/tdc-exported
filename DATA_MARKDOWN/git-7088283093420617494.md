        In France, about half of all gamers are women, but they remain underrepresented in the video game industry. For the 10th edition of the Paris Games Week fair, running from 30 October to 3 November, the organisation "Women in Games" joined the fray with a dedicated stall.
      
The organisation was created in 2017 and today counts 1,600 members. It promotes the involvement of both sexes in the video game industry.
"Currently only 15 percent of the group are women – and there are few in the key posts. For example, there are only 5 percent in programming," says Lucie Schlindwein, project manager for Women in Games.
