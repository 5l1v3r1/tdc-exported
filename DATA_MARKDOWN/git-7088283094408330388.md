        Storm Amélie blasted the Atlantic coast early Sunday, whipping up giant ocean waves, uprooting trees and leaving some 140,000 people in southwest France without electricity. But no deaths or injuries have been reported.
      
Fourteen of metropolitan France's 95 departments were placed on high alert as storm Amelie brought heavy rains to the Atlantic coast. Winds topped 160 kilometres per hour in some places.
