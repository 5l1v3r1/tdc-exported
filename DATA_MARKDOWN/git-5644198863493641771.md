SHANGHAI: China's tobacco regulator on Friday issued a notice asking e-commerce platforms and businesses to shut online stores that sell electronic cigarette products, in a move aimed at stopping minors from purchasing e-cigarettes through the internet.
The notice was published on the website of state monopoly China Tobacco, which is overseen by the country's tobacco regulator.
