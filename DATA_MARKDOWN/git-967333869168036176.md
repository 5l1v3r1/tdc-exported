        ST. PETERSBURG (Sputnik) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may visit Russia in connection with the opening of the TurkStream gas pipeline this year, Turkish Ambassador Mehmet Samsar said at a meeting with Leningrad Region Governor Alexander Drozdenko on Tuesday.
      
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov addressed the statement, stressing the date of the possible visit has not been determined yet.
Several EU countries (including Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia) previously said they wanted to participate in the project.
The TurkStream twin-pipeline will have a maximum capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres (1.1 trillion cubic feet) per year.
The first leg will deliver Russian gas under the Black Sea to Turkey for local consumption by 1 January 2020. The second leg is expected to carry gas to Southern and Central Europe, but its route has not been determined yet.
