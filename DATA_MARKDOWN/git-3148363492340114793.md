Spicer has made it week after week on DWTS, despite receiving relatively low scores from the judges. Voter support has clearly carried him through each week– so much that he has yet to find himself in the bottom two. His victory last week left many leftist viewers in disbelief, spurring a flurry of complaints on social media.
Spicer’s stay appeared to irk The Daily Show host Trevor Noah, as well. While he told his audience that “people on the left don’t care if a conservative wins Dancing with the Stars,” he devoted an eight-minute segment to Spicer’s presence on the show, lamenting the support he continues to receive from conservatives and Breitbart Nation, particularly.
