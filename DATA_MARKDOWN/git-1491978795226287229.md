Rapper attacks cabinet minister for saying fire victims should have used ‘common sense’
Attempts by Jacob Rees-Mogg to draw a line under his remarks that the victims of the Grenfell fire lacked “common sense” have drawn a furious reaction from survivors and campaigners.
The rapper Stormzy joined relatives, including the nephew of a Grenfell Tower victim who died after being told to stay put by the London fire brigade, in angrily dismissing the cabinet minister’s statement that victims should have left the burning tower block.
The leader of the House of Commons issued “a profound apology” after he told a radio interviewer: “I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do.”
Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rehman, 57, died in the fire, said Rees-Mogg was an “idiot” whose remarks revealed the detachment of the government from the Grenfell community.
“The apology is too late,” he told the Guardian. “Sorry means nothing. It’s such an easy word to say. Your action means something but we have had words and no action.”
