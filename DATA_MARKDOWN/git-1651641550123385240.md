To foil hackers, it’s already been established that you should place your electric car key fob away from your front door; but now, it looks like you have to take similar precautions for your Smart Home Assistant.
According to a new study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo; lasers can now be used to hijack voice assistant devices.
While the scheme seems quite far-fetched, it’s actually a lot easier to carry out than you may think- especially if your device sits close to a window.
The video below describes the mechanism in better detail, but in brief- a laser -modulated by a laser driver and audio amplifier- can focus its beam onto the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones of smart home devices, to mimic a human voice.
