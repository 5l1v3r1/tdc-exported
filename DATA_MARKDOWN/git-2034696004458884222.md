        Tweet presages scare the living shit out of me
      
A My Chemical Romance tweet from 2011 appears to have predicted the recent Chilean uprising – eight years before it took place.
The mysterious tweet ended with the words “Stay safe in 2019”. It was posted during the band’s ‘Danger Days’ era, which was partially built around a post-apocalyptic mythology set in 2019, potentially explaining the mention of that year. However it seems the band didn’t play Chile while touring that album, leaving many to speculate why they specifically directed the message at that country.
