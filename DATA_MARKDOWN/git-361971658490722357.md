On Monday, November 4, The FADER parted ways with its Head of Content, Eric Sundermann, a spokesperson for the publication has confirmed to Pitchfork. The decision comes just days after after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against Sundermann on Twitter.
“Eric Sundermann’s employment with The FADER was terminated yesterday following a prompt internal investigation into allegations that senior executives were made aware of over the weekend,” the spokesperson for the Fader said in a statement. The spokesperson offered no comment when asked by Pitchfork if the tweets prompted the investigation.
In September, The FADER celebrated its 20th anniversary with special issues and a vinyl record. Sundermann joined The FADER in December 2018, soon after the publication let go of several staff members including the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine. The role of Editor-in-Chief has not been replaced since Sundermann’s appointment as Head of Content. He was previously the Editor-in-Chief at Noisey.
Pitchfork has reached out to Eric Sundermann and The FADER’s president and publisher Andy Cohn for further comment.
