Stoke City have targeted Alex Neil to become their next manager after the sacking of Nathan Jones - but Preston have denied them permission to speak to the former Hamilton boss.
Jones was dismissed on Friday after their poor start to the season and the Potters are quickly looking to bring in a replacement.
Preston North End boss Neil is reportedly at the top of their shortlist, but according to the BBC an approach has been rejected.
Stoke could also face possible sanctions, with Preston alleging that an illegal approach has been made for their manager.
The Championship outfit had hoped to hold talks with Neil over the vacant position by Monday after Preston take on West Brom this weekend, but that is now in doubt as relations between the clubs break down.
Neil has helped steer Preston to second position in the table after a brilliant start to the campaign.
Stoke , on the other hand, are rooted to the bottom which led the club to relieving Jones of his duties.
Neil, born in Bellshill, managed Hamilton in 2013 for two seasons before taking charge of Norwich and then joining Preston.
