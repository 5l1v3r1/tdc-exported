The Stellar Development Foundation’s (SDF) unanimous decision to burn XLM’s supply by half could spell troubles for the project, believes noted bitcoin maximalist WhalePanda.
The anonymous trader on Tuesday said the cryptocurrency exchanges could start treating XLM as security, explaining that SDF showed excessive control over the blockchain asset when they cut down its supply from 105 billion to 50 billion. The move increased the chances of getting XLM delisted from exchanges that have been careful about which digital asset they would list on their trading platforms.
