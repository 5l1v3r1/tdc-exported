Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday said his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government has saved the country $1.2 billion that Pakistan had to pay to Turkey’s Karkey rental power plant as penalty.
“PTI government, with the help of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has amicably resolved the Karkey dispute and saved Pakistan USD 1.2 billion penalty imposed by ICSID (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes),” he said in a tweet on Monday.
“I want to congratulate the government’s negotiating team for doing an excellent job in achieving this,” he added.
