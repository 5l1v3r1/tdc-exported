Negan is living that free life on The Walking Dead now that he escaped Alexandria. But he's not flying solo as previews show that Negan will have a traveling companion in the form of Brandon on The Walking Dead. Brandon has appeared in Season 10 as the person who oversees Negan's farm work at Alexandria. While not much else is known about Brandon (at least on the TV series), his choice of traveling companion could majorly cost him.
In the trailer for the fifth episode of Season 10, Brandon is shown with Negan outside of the community. "You're fast. Took me forever to catch up," Brandon says with a smile. From this preview, it sure seems that Brandon may have been the one to release Negan from his jail cell after the death of Margo. But The Walking Dead previews usually can't be trusted (just look at that Ezekiel and Michonne kiss) and Brandon's character is already pretty different from his comic one. Yet, his story may just catch up with the one in the graphic novels by Robert Kirkman now that Negan is free â€” which is exciting for Negan, but not great for Brandon.
