        BlizzCon 2019’s annual BlizzCon Q&A was broken up by one brave kid shouting for Hong Kong’s liberation. 
      
After the reveal of the new World of Warcraft expansion Shadowlands, Blizzard hosted a Q&A session for fans to learn more about the upcoming content.
During the panel, one fan was asked if they had anything else to say. “Uh, yeah,” the fan replied. “Free Hong Kong, Revolution of our Age.” It’s a short clip, but the host looks unsurprisingly shaken up. With Blizzard firing Hearthstone casters for Pro-player Blitzchung’s pro-revolution speech, it’s a dangerous position to be in.
The BlizzCon Q&A continues: directly after the questioner exits the frame, a child can be heard in the background. “Free Hong Kong,” the child chants. As another fan goes up to ask his question, the child continues, “Free Hong Kong, Free Hong Kong!”
The child eventually makes his way down to the camera, continually chanting.
“You got a question, mate?” The interviewer asks.
“Yeah,” the child replies. “Free Hong Kong.”
