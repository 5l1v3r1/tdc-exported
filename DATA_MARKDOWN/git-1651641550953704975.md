During Ignite 2019 keynote, Microsoft revealed a new service called Azure Arc which extends Azure services and management to any infrastructure. Until now, Azure management only allowed customers to manage their Azure resources. With Azure Arc, you can now manage Linux and Windows servers, as well as Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud and edge. With Azure Arc, Azure management capabilities like Azure Resource Manager, Azure Shell, Azure Portal, API, and Azure Policy can now be used for any infrastructure.
