“We, the undergraduate Harvard Law students, write to request an expansion of HLS’s clinical offerings to accommodate the wide range of goals and career interests reflected in the student body,” states the petition addressed to the School’s dean and assistant dean.
“The practical skill development and real-world impact available through clinics offer an integral component of a high-quality and community-focused legal education,” elaborate the students in their petition. “At present, however, the clinical offerings available to students with right-of-center viewpoints are lacking, particularly as compared to other law schools.”
More than 80 students have signed the petition calling on Harvard Law School (HLS) to offer legal clinics covering right-of-center political viewpoints.
A few of the topics that students suggest would make for beneficial legal clinics include: pro-life, First Amendment, Second Amendment, school choice, and conservative appellate advocacy.
