DURHAM, N.H. (AP) - The University of New Hampshire is holding a Food Solutions Forum to address how issues such as climate change, minimum wage and immigration affect the state’s food system.
Two panels are discussing the challenges and opportunities facing New Hampshire’s food economy on Tuesday.
Perspectives will range from those of regional advocates to the hearing from people who get up every day and help feed families across the state.
UNH says almost 100,000 New Hampshire jobs drive the state’s food system and its farmers and fisheries alone contribute over $230 million annually to the state’s economy.
