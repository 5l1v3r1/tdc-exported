To some he is a true comedy legend. To others, he's the man with the best brows in the business.
However you see him, there is no denying that Jimeoin is downright hilarious.
The Irish stand-up comic is now touring his latest show, Result, around the Hunter and Central Coast in November and December with stops scheduled for Belmont, Hexham, Cessnock, Doyalson and New Lambton.
"It's just really a lot of nonsense and you're none the wiser at the end of it all," Jimeoin said of Result.
"It's just a daft show, that's the idea of it, and it's a fun show. It's not political and it never really has been political.
"It's an hour show that I hope people will come by and have a good laugh at. I haven't had a go at anybody other than myself."
