        The event, backed by the Julian Assange Defence Committee, Socialist Equality Party and Stop the War Coalition, gathered hundreds across the UK and abroad outside the UK Home Office to protest the Wikileaks founder's extradition to the United States.
      
UK fashion designer and activist Vivienne Westwood addressed the crowd alongside Assange's father, John Shipton, Stop the War Coalition national officer, John Rees, Diem 25 party co-founder, Srecko Horvat, and UK hip-hop artist Mathangi Arulpragasam (MIA).
She encouraged everyone in Britain to read the Australian whisleblower's documents, stating that it was “the most important report from the last 10 years”.
Speaking on Assange’s 21 October hearing at Westminster Magistrate’s Court, she slammed it as a “show trial” where “the guilty verdict is already decided. It's a sham."
