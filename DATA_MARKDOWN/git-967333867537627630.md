        KATOWICE, Poland (Sputnik) – President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach said on Tuesday that the new doping testing method — Dried Blood Spots (DBS) — will be introduced no later than by the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.
      
He described the method as one of the most promising research projects in the anti-doping efforts.
Commenting on the possible participation of Russian athletes in the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the IOC president told Sputnik that the final decision on the issue would be made by WADA.
In September, WADA launched a new non-compliance procedure against Russia and gave the Russian Anti-Doping Agency three weeks to explain "inconsistencies" that the anti-doping watchdog found in probes received from the Moscow anti-doping laboratories earlier this year.  After receiving the data from Moscow, WADA's investigation and intelligence department suspected that the records had been manipulated before being submitted.
Russia sent its response to WADA on 8 October, with the latter having vowed to analyse the information by the end of November.
