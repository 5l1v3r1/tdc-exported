As Netflix faces increased competition with the release of two major streaming services this week, it appears Netflix is getting into the scripted podcasts game.
A six-episode scripted series, The Only Podcast Left, will complement the streaming giant’s post-apocalyptic series Daybreak and will splinter from season 1 of the show to build its narrative, Variety first reported Thursday. According to the report, the podcast is slated to premiere 7 November in partnership with Spotify, where it will stream exclusively until 12 December.
Netflix has been pivoting to podcasts, so to speak, for some time now with shows centred around its own content. You Can’t Make This Up, for example, covers Netflix’s true crime and nonfiction content, exploring topics like “how our filmmakers got access, what ended up on the cutting room floor, and even the impact a Netflix show can have on the real lives of its subjects.” What to Watch on Netflix, another of its podcasts with a pretty straightforward theme, invites Netflix employees, stars, and other notable figures to comment on what they’re watching on the platform.
