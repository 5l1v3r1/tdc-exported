        VOLGOGRAD (Sputnik) - The Russian Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has slammed Lithuanian news portal Ekspertai's claims that the Rossiya Segodnya news agency allegedly sponsors terrorism as a classic example of "hoax" and "bullying."
      
Ekspertai's claim is a classic example of hoax and disinformation, Zakharova added.
"Loud headline but no proof," Zakharova stressed.
On 30 October, Ekspertai published a story on the Danish authorities' consent to laying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. RIA Novosti, which "belongs to the international media group Rossiya Segodnya, engaged in the financing of terrorism and money laundering", was named as a source of information. A reference was made to the material on the same portal about the receipt by an unnamed citizen of Lithuania of a letter from Sweden's Swedbank with a notification that the credit organisation had stopped settlements with the media group.
The press service of the Rossiya Segodnya news agency refuted the statement as slander and demanded apologies, stressing readiness to defend its rights and honours in court.
