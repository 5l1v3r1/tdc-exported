Chevron Corp.’s third-quarter earnings missed estimates, making it the only oil major to fall short of analysts’ predictions, after reporting a US$430 million tax charge and weak upstream results amid declining prices for crude and natural gas.
Shale output from the Permian basin rose 35 \per cent to 455,000 barrels of oil per day from a year earlier, the company said Friday.
