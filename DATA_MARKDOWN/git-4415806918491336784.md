Sadio Mane rescued Liverpool as the Reds’ late show at Aston Villa maintained their title charge.
The forward’s stoppage-time header earned a thrilling 2-1 win just as Jurgen Klopp’s side looked like losing their unbeaten Premier League record.
Andrew Robertson had equalised with just three minutes left to cancel out Trezeguet’s first-half opener for the hosts.
Klopp saw his unbeaten side maintain their six-point lead at the top after Manchester City’s 2-1 comeback win over Southampton.
The top two face off at Anfield next Sunday after they both narrowly avoided upsets on Saturday.
VAR had earlier created more controversy when Roberto Firmino’s first-half strike was ruled offside, forcing the Premier League to clarify the decision at half-time.

Liverpool’s last visit to Villa Park saw them thump Villa 6-0 with the hosts waving the white flag en route to an embarrassing relegation three years ago.
But they faced a different, resurgent Villa this time, underlined by the way Anwar El Ghazi bundled his way through to fire at Alisson Becker after 31 seconds.
