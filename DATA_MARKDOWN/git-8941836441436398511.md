ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The football game between Air Force and New Mexico scheduled for this weekend was postponed following the death of a Lobos defensive lineman.
Air Force will travel to New Mexico on Nov. 23 instead, the Mountain West said Wednesday.
New Mexico announced the death of 21-year-old Nahje Flowers on Tuesday. The university didn’t provide a cause or other circumstances. Flowers was from Los Angeles, where he played football at Dorsey High School. He had been at New Mexico since 2016.
This season, Flowers had 13 tackles and 1 1/2 sack.
In a release, Mountain West Commissioner Craig Thompson said the focus should be on “the family, friends and teammates who have been affected during this difficult time.”
