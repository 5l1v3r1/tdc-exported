Liam Gallagher has thanked MTV’s EMAs for “recognising his brilliance” after he received the first ever Rock Icon Award at the ceremony.
The former Oasis and Beady Eye frontman was honoured at the event in Seville, Spain, for his work in both groups as well as his work as a solo artist.
Accepting the award, Gallagher said: “Thank you man. I won’t keep you too long but I want to congratulate Seville for having a lovely city. I want to congratulate MTV for recognising my brilliance. Thanks for the award. I wear it well.” After the short speech, Gallagher walked quickly off stage.
Gallagher also performed new song ‘Once’ and Oasis classic ‘Wonderwall’ at the event. During the latter, Gallagher changed the lyrics of the song to: “there are many things I would like to say to you…but I don’t speak Spanish.” You can watch footage of the moment below.
