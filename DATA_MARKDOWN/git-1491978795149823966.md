        Preah Sihanouk governor says autopsy has determined cause of British backpacker’s death
      
An autopsy has determined the British backpacker Amelia Bambridge, whose body was found at sea a week after she disappeared, died from drowning, a Cambodian official has said.
The governor of Preah Sihanouk province said her body was examined at the main hospital in Sihanoukville, where it was taken after being found on Thursday in the Gulf of Thailand.
Bambridge, 21, disappeared after attending a beach party on the night of 23 October on the island of Koh Rong. Her body was discovered by fishermen about 60 miles (97km) away.
The provincial police chief had earlier said the autopsy would be attended by forensic police, a hospital doctor, a court prosecutor, a representative of the British embassy and members of Bambridge’s family.
