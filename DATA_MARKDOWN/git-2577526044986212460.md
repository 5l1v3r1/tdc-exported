The Dark Souls modding community has made a major breakthrough that could bring player-made maps to the game. Last night, modder Dropoff uploaded a video documenting a test of the game’s first-ever custom map.
The community’s first offering is inspired by Crossfire, a multiplayer map from the original Half-Life. As a result, it’s relatively simplistic, and doesn’t really capture the fantasy setting of the Souls Games. According to modder Katalash on Reddit, however, it’s still a major breakthrough.
