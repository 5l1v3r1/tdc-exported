        MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Two people were killed and another person is missing as gas and air mixture exploded on board a tanker in Russia's Far Eastern Nakhodka Bay, the regional branch of the Investigative Committee said in a statement on Saturday.
      
The investigators have launched a criminal case over the incident.
A spokesperson of the Nakhodka port authority said earlier on Saturday that the blast took place on board the Zaliv Amerika oil tanker.
In 2016, another accident happened in the Russian port when the oil spill took place over an area of 1,500 square meters.
