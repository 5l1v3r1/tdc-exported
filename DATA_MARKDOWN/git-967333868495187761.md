        The event, titled "How Media Bias Shapes the Gender Identity Debate", was initially expected to take place at Simon Fraser University, which withdrew as host at the last minute, citing security concerns.
      
“The self-righteous cowards and censors win again.” For Jordan Peterson, this was the bottom line of an event featuring Canadian free-speech activists which was cancelled over threats of violence.
The event, "How media bias shapes the gender identity debate" was scheduled to be held at the Vancouver campus of Simon Fraser University on Saturday, 2 November.
The speaking panel was slated to feature Meghan Murphy, the journalist banned from Twitter for challenging pro-transgender views and “misgendering” the biologically male transgender woman Jessica Yaniv; Jonathan Kay, the Canadian editor of conservative website Quillette; and Anna Slatz, a journalist who has extensively covered Yaniv’s infamous “scrotum waxing” case and uncovered allegations of child predation by the trans-activist.
