Wet weather in the form of snow visited southern Alberta Tuesday, with an Environment Canada snowfall warning remaining into the evening for the foothills west and south of Calgary. As much as 30 centimetres of snow was expected in some areas.
Warnings were issued Tuesday morning for the regions of Kananaskis-Canmore, Okotoks-High River and Crowsnest Pass-Waterton Lakes. Although Calgary was expected to miss most of the snow, some did fall in the city and temperatures were predicted to plunge Tuesday night to -13 C.
Most of the foothills snow was expected to taper off Tuesday evening for northern regions, while the rest was expected to fall by Wednesday morning.
With the weather came plenty of collisions. Mounties warned people to avoid travel Tuesday evening on Highway 1 between Bassano and Brooks as icy road conditions gripped the area. At least four vehicles hit the ditch in that stretch, RCMP reported, with one social media user reporting seeing a semi jackknifed west of Brooks.
