Ford has revealed the logo for its upcoming Bronco, and confirmed the rough-and-ready crossover will launch in the first half of 2020.
Although speculation and spy photos have been flying, this is the first official mention of the Bronco since Ford's press conference at the Detroit motor show in January.
When it launches in the Northern Hemisphere's spring (our autumn), the 2020 Bronco will pick up a badge that's been dormant since 1996 in the USA.
