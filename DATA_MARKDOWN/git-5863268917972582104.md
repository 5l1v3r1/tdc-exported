ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – As the sit-in protest led by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) in Islamabad enters its second day; the opposition’s Rehbar Committee has planned to hold its next meeting at 2pm today.
The meeting is expected to ponder over the next course of action for the demonstration to proceed aimed at increasing pressure on the government for making it accept the demands of opposition.
The leaders expected to attend the meeting include PPP’s Farhatullah Babar and Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal and Ayaz Sadiq, Awami National Party general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain, National Party Senator Tahir Bizenjo, and others.
Meanwhile, the government negotiation committee’s member Sadiq Sanjrani, the chairman of the Senate, has made a contact with the Rehbar Committee’s member Nayyar Bukhari, persuading him to hold a round of talks with the government for the resolution of conflicts.
However, Bukhari told Sanjrani that this matter, about whether to hold talks, would be decided after consultation amongst members of the Rehbar Committee.
Moreover, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry terms Azadi March’s participants as "bunch of opportunists" and warns them not to "underestimate" the government.
