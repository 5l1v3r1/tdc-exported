With the remarkably versatile Kate McKinnon at the helm, this weekend’s "Saturday Night Live" cold open took aim at Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s $52 trillion "Medicare-for-all" health care plan.
“I am in my natural habitat – a public school on a weekend,” McKinnon's excitable Warren quipped at an Iowa town hall, complete with fist pumps, some "whoos" and the senator’s signature raspy voice.
She also took a moment to give former Rep. Beto O’Rourke a sendoff after he dropped out of the race last week.

“Let me know how my dust tastes,” she said.
After mentioning that she pays taxes in every state “out of principle,” she took questions from cast members playing ambivalent voters.
Asked why it took her so long to release her health care plan, McKinnon’s Warren answered, “When Bernie [Sanders] was talking 'Medicare-for-all', everybody was like, ‘Oh cool,’ and then they turned to me and said, ‘Fix it, Mom.’”
She added that her plan “compares favorably” to former Vice President Joe Biden’s “in that it exists.”
