A film starring Stephen Fry is to be screened in Tavistock, where the director will also take part in a question and answer session.
Tomorrow is a film that depicts the reality of PTSD and has a number of links to the South West.
Stuart Brennan, lead producer of the film, is from Barnstaple and it also stars Joss Stone, who has spent large parts of her life in Devon.
The story centres around Tesla, a military man who returns home to London after getting injured by an IED in Afghanistan.
He struggles to adapt to civilian life until he makes an unlikely friendship with a character called Sky.
The story is based on experiences that many of the military go through and this special screening will also see various members of Help for Heroes and veterans take part in the Q&A session alongside director Martha Pinson.
