CLEVELAND — Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic have performed the world’s first kidney transplant using a single-port robot, according to a press release from the clinic.
The single-port kidney transplant enables all surgical instruments and the donor kidney to be placed through one small abdominal incision.
Dr. Jihad Kaouk and his team were the first hospital in the country to successfully perform a robotic single-port prostatectomy and kidney cancer surgery in September 2018.
“The aim was not only to make a smaller incision, but also to minimize the area in which the operation was performed by limiting the number of cuts inside the patient,” Kaouk said in a news release. “This resulted in minimal post-operative pain and no opioids needed after surgery.”
